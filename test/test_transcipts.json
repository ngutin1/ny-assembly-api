His greatest legacy lives on with his wife Mary-Anna, his \nchildren, grandchildren, and all those whose lives he touched.

In a country and a place that you might not have \nchosen to call home where justice and safety is afforded to everyone \nthat's not you, where, you know, your dollar does not hold up to your \nchildren and you're guaranteed nothing but an uphill battle, a mecca \nemerges for you.  And for Malcolm X, that mecca was Harlem.  And \nHarlem's heartbeat is called Lenox Avenue, otherwise known as \nMalcolm X Boulevard.  And a city considered to be of important \nstreets and a world of African-American culture, Malcolm X's home \nwas Harlem.  He honed his craft preaching on its streets.  And in \nHarlem he began his own religious organization, and in the Audubon \nBallroom where he was assassinated at 39 now bears his name.  And \nsoon, too, will the 110th Street Train Station, Lenox Avenue Train \nStation.  \nSo allowing all transit riders to share in the legacy of \none of New York's greatest individuals, a significant piece of Harlem \nhistory, I am proud to vote in the affirmative and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do so as well.

ZINERMAN:  Dear colleagues, and I rise in \nsupport and proud support of my bill to rename Utica Avenue train \nstation in Brooklyn to Malcolm X Boulevard and Utica Avenue on the \nsacred occasion of what would have been his 100th birthday of \nMalcolm X.  This renaming is not just symbolic, it is overdue.  In \n1985 the people of Bedford-Stuyvesant successfully renamed Reid \nAvenue to Malcolm X Boulevard to honor one of the most \ntransformative leaders of the 20th Century.  But for nearly four \ndecades, the MTA station at the intersection continued to bear only \nthe name of Utica Avenue.  Today we set that record straight.  This \neffort is the result of tireless community organizing, and I want to \nuplift the name of Kazembe Batts and the December 12th Movement, \nas well as the many residents, elders, youth who marched, petitioned \nand never came up on this vision.  This victory belongs to you. \nMalcolm X, el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, stood for truth, \npower and the liberation of Black people across the globe.  His name \nat this station will be a daily reminder to our young people that they \ncome from greatness and that they, too, can make history.  \nI want to thank Speaker Carl Heastie for his steadfast \nsupport.  As -- as the first African-American Speaker of this Body, \nyour leadership brings an added weight and pride to this moment. \nFinally, this act honors the enduring connection \nbetween Brooklyn and Harlem; two pillars of Black culture, resistance \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n14and elegant -- and excellence.  Elegance, too.  Let this renaming be a \nmodel for what we can achieve when we work across districts to \npreserve our legacy and to uplift our shared future. \nI urge your support and I vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Zinerman in \nthe affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

An act to \namend the Civil Practice Law and Rules, the Education Law, the \nPublic Health Law, the Judiciary Law, the Insurance Law, the General \nBusiness Law, the Criminal Procedure Law, the Executive Law, the \nCivil Rights Law, and the Family Court Act, in relation to protecting \nindividuals who provide or receive legally-protected health activity \nfrom criminal or civil liability or professional sanctions imposed by \njurisdictions  outside the State; and to repeal certain provisions of the \nCriminal Procedure Law and the Executive Law relating thereto.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Bronson. \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  This bill \nexpands New York's existing SHIELD Law by expanding protections \nto explicitly include gender-affirming care and reenforcing the legal \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n16infrastructure that supports providers, patients and facilitators of \nlegally-provided healthcare.  It ensures that sensitive health data held \nby private institutions is protected; prohibits participation by those \nprivate institutions and hostile out-of-State legal actions; empowers \nthe Attorney General to act; and expands jurisdiction al, procedural \nand professional safeguards. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh.\nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes, I will, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  So, initially I \nwanted to note that I believe it was earlier this Session we passed a \nbill, Assembly Bill 5285, a -- a different sponsor, and that had to do \nspecifically with abortion providers in our State and shielding them \nfrom out-of-state, you know, action against them whether it was \ncriminal or civil.  And how does this bill -- does this bill represent an \nexpansion of that legislation, which I think has already been signed by \nthe Governor?  \nMR. BRONSON:  It -- it -- it doesn't specifically \naddress those.  This addresses slightly different issues.  We do expand \ncertain types of providers that would be protected versus what is \ncurrent law.  But we also are making sure that we are protecting the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n17health data and information that private institutions may have. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So does this bill impact only \nthose who are providing gender-affirming care or does it also include \nthose who are providing abortion services?  \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes.  Through you, Madam \nSpeaker, this bill creates a definition of legally health [sic] protected \nservices, and that will include reproductive services as well as gender- \naffirming care.  When we passed the SHIELD Acts in 2022 and 2023, \nunfortunately we created a -- a disconnect or a conflict in our statutes.  \nSo what this bill does is it tries to clean that up and puts both of those \ntypes of healthcare services in a definition indicating that they're \nlegally-protected services, and then we make reference to the various \nprotections to that definition. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So, yes.  And I noted that the \n2022 Chapter 143, which was your bill as well, to essentially make \nNew York a sanctuary state for gender-affirming care by welcoming \nout-of-state actors to receive gender-related treatments in the State.  \nThat law prohibits law enforcement from cooperating with or \nproviding information to out-of-state agencies related to \ngender-affirming care services.  Is that accurate?\nMR. BRONSON:  So through you, Madam Speaker, I \nthink the use of the phrase \"sanctuary state\" is problematic.  What \nwe're trying to do is protect people who are seeking, providing, or \nfacilitating the providing of legally healthcare -- legal healthcare here \nin the State.  We want to protect people who are receiving that care in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n18the State, and we want to make sure that those folks are not \nprosecuted either civilly or criminally by hostile states who have a \ndifferent policy position than we do here in this State. \nMS. WALSH:  So one -- and I -- I -- I appreciate \nwhat you're saying.  And pardon my lack of understanding on this, but \nI understand that if we're talking about abortion services, there's \nsomebody -- a doctor could be in New York State and through \ntelehealth prescribe medication to be taken by somebody in a different \nstate to result in an abortion.  But for gender-affirming care, is -- is \nthat the case as well, or are we only talking about specifically surgical \nchanges which I -- I would assume not, you know, that way?  \nMR. BRONSON:  Gender-affirming care is much \nbroader than surgical care.  It could be hormonal treatment --\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, that's what I thought.\nMR. BRONSON:  -- it could be hormonal blockers.  \nIt can be a lot -- it could be therapy.  It could be a lot of different \nthings.  What we are doing here, whether it's reproductive health or \ngender-affirming care, is saying that if you are providing that care here \nin New York State and it's legal care, even if it's telemedicine, to \nsomebody outside the State that that physician and any facilitators of \nproviding that care will be protected by New York State law.  And we \neven go further -- through you, Madam Speaker, we even go further \nand we -- we create a conflicts of law situation where we deem that \nthe laws of New York State would apply in those situations. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So -- (coughing) -- excuse me. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n19So as we were just discussing, the -- if it is something like a hormone \nblocker or something like that would be medication that could be \nprescribed through telehealth out-of-state then that would be covered \nunder this -- under this legislation.  And also any surgical treatments \nto support gender-affirming care that would be actually performed in \nNew York State?  \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes.  We -- the intention of the \nlaw is to protect that, as well as it was for reproductive health in the \nprevious law, which is, you know, going through the court system as \nwe speak. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Yes, it is.  \nSo how about -- and this might -- this might be not \neven a thing that really happens, but what if you had a New York \nState doctor travel to another state to actually perform a surgery that \nwould be -- come under the umbrella of gender-affirming care.  \nWould that be encompassed by this legislation as well to shield that \ndoctor?  \nMR. BRONSON:  It would not.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. BRONSON:  It has to be services provided \nwithin the State, and they have to be legal services pursuant to New \nYork State law. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Very good. \nNow, could we please talk about the -- the actual \nresponse that will be had then?  There may be subpoenas that may be  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n20served upon a provider in New York State or -- in order to compel \ntestimony.  So could you just discuss for a moment about how those \nwill be treated under this legislation? \nMR. BRONSON:  Sure.  So whether it's a -- a \nsubpoena or in a civil action an information instrument, we are \nrequiring under this piece of legislation that that subpoena or the \ninformational instrument would have an affirmation attached to it in \norder to be enforceable.  And that affirmation has to declare that the \npurpose of the subpoena or informational instrument is not to pursue a \ncriminal or civil action against a person here in New York State who \nhas either received, provided or facilitated legally-protected healthcare \nhere in New York State. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And for violating these \nrequirements there will be a -- the bill imposes a $15,000 penalty per \nviolation of submitting a false affirmation if the court finds that it was \nmade intentionally, knowingly, willingly or recklessly? \nMR. BRONSON:  Through you, Madam Speaker, \nthat's correct.  Sorry. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And what is the role of the \nAttorney General in this whole process?  \nMR. BRONSON:  We are giving the Attorney \nGeneral authority to enforce these -- this law if it's signed by the \nGovernor, which I certainly hope it is, and the Attorney General will \nbe able to bring cases in connection with the subpoenas and \ninformational instruments. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n21MS. WALSH:  Now, you mentioned that the previous \nlegislation from earlier in this Session, that -- that earlier Assembly \nbill, that that is currently being tested in the -- in the courts?  \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay. \nMR. BRONSON:  I believe it was a situation where \nabortion medication was prescribed by a physician here to somebody \nthrough telemedicine to somebody outside the State. \nMS. WALSH:  Was that the -- there was a case \ninvolving Louisiana, I believe.  There was -- there was a situation.  I \ndon't know if that was that one.  There were a couple I think I \nmentioned on that debate.  \nMR. BRONSON:  Yeah.  There -- there's a couple.  I \ncan't speak to them off -- off the top of my head here today. \nMS. WALSH:  No, I -- I appreciate that.  I -- I was \njust curious more than anything else. \nI -- I was wondering, I guess, by the way of question \nwhy you thought it best to advance this bill now when we have \nongoing litigation that may have an impact.  So if you could speak to \nthat. \nMR. BRONSON:  Absolutely.  Through you, Mr. \nSpeaker, it's because of the hostile nature and the context in which we \nlive.  It's because there are states, and to some degree, a Federal \nGovernment that has chosen to go contrary to the public policy of this \nState.  Public policy, which I would reiterate, was just reaffirmed \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n22through a Constitutional amendment last November  by the voters, and \nthat is we hold dear the right of women to bodily autonomy and \nreproductive choice.  We hold dear the right of the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity to live authentically.  And if they choose, a trans member \nof the community to go through gender-affirming care, that we are \ngoing to protect them and their providers and their families and others \nin that situation.  So the why is quite simply that we're in hostile \nterritory here by some other states and by the Federal Government. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much for your \nanswers.\nMr. Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER DILAN:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you.  So I think that that last \nresponse really does kind of set the table for what we're discussing \ntoday.  And of course if this bill is passed today and it -- it is signed by \nthe Governor, then anyone who is bringing any kind of lawsuits to \nchallenge that earlier legislation can simply amend and add this one, \ntoo, onto the pile.  Because this -- this -- if you didn't like the last bill, \nand the vote was 96 to 51, you're not gonna like this one either, \nbecause it -- it just simply expands our SHIELD laws to encompass \nmore things.  And, you know, I mean, there are -- there are concerns \nthat have been raised about both reproductive services, abortion \nservices and also gender-affirming care, and shielding those \nphysicians or medical people that are providing this from -- from \nbeing known even who they are.  And in the -- in the prior debate that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n23we had, which I didn't feel a need to go all the way through again, but \nthere's a -- there is a concern, there's a downside to shielding \npractitioners from even being known who they are.  Because if \nsomething goes wrong, it -- it's going to be difficult to track down who \nthat -- who that physician or provider is.  \nSo just as we, many of us in a bipartisan way opposed \nthe previous bill, I would expect that we will -- we will have similar \nopposition today, and I will not be supporting this legislation.  I would \ncertainly encourage my colleagues to also vote no.  Thank you very \nmuch, Mr. Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER DILAN:  Mrs. Peoples-Stokes.\nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Mr. Speaker, if you \nwould please call the Ways and Means Committee to the Speaker's \nConference Room immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER DILAN:  Ways and Means, \nSpeaker's Conference Room.  Immediate Ways and Means, Speaker's \nConference Room.  \nRead the last section. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER DILAN:  A Party vote has been \nrequested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS.

If there are any affirmative votes they can be cast now at \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n24members' desks.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER DILAN:  Mrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, sir.  The \nMajority Conference is gonna be in favor of this piece of legislation; \nhowever there may be a few that would desire to be an exception.  \nThey should feel free to do so. \nACTING SPEAKER DILAN:  The Clerk will record \nthe vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Bronson to \nexplain his vote. \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  I abstain on \nmy vote for the purposes of explaining my vote. \nThis bill is vitally necessary and important.  \nReproductive freedom and gender-affirming care and gender justice \nare un -- under unprecedented attack not only from other states in our \nUnion, but also from the Federal Government.  Individuals who \nchoose to make bodily autonomy choices and to live authentically \ndeserve protections of New York State.  In fact, last November  we \nenshrined in our Constitution reproductive rights.  We enshrined in \nour Constitution sex -- sexual orientation rights and gender-affirming \ncare rights through gender identity.  We need to continue to have laws \nthat fulfill our Constitutional requirements.  We need to continue to \nhave laws that see the humanity, the dignity of every human being.  \nWe need to continue to have laws here in New York State that looks \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n25at our diversity as our strength, and make sure that we honor our \ndiversity, we honor all people for their humanity and their dignity.  \nFor those reasons, Madam Speaker, I proudly vote in \nthe affirmative on this piece of legislation.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Bronson in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nPage 9, Rules Report No. 406, the Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A08295-D, Rules \nReport No. 406, Otis, McDonald, Simon, Colton, Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas, \nShrestha, Smith, Lunsford, Levenberg, Shimsky, Paulin, Kassay, \nMcMahon, Santabarbara.  An act to amend the State Technology Law, \nthe Education Law and the Civil Service Law, in relation to automated \ndecision-making by government agencies.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Mr. \nOtis, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is advanced. \nAn explanation has been requested.\nMr. Otis. \nMR. OTIS:  Thank you.  This bill follows on a bill \nthat we passed last year with sort of the beginning of a framework of a \nState agency guidance and oversight and transparency, especially for \nthe uses of AI tools in, in this case, State, local government, school \ndistricts.  And -- and -- and what the bill does is it basically provides \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n26for disclosure of AI tools that are used; a -- a -- assessment impact \nstatement of those tools that are used posting on websites; guidance by \nthe Office of Information Technology Services on these kinds of tools.  \nAnd why it is necessary is because AI is gonna to be with us, we all \nknow that.  But we really need the guardrails, guidance to make sure \nthat if you're a State agency or a local agency using AI that you're \nusing it intelligently, you know that the tool that you're using is of \ngood quality, and is -- this is to protect the quality of work by \ngovernmental entities and protect the public and actually help \ngovernmental agencies do this work better. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gandolfo. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor please yield for a couple of questions?  \nMR. OTIS:  Of course. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  And thank you for that \nexplanation. \nSo my first question would be, are any of these \nautomated AI-based decision-making tools currently being used in \nState government or are they ubiquitous throughout county or local \ngovernments?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, we're not totally sure, which is one \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n27of the reasons why the bill is so important.  What we did last year was \nwe imposed these guidelines for a State gov -- State agencies as it \nrelates to employment decisions, sort of narrow.  This broadens it to \nall AI use, but is very similar.  I will say that last year we did a chapter \namendment process, and so we sort of narrowed down the scope of \nthis to mostly a transparency and disclosure process.  And that's what \nthis bill does, but for all government use. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  And the disclosure itself, \nwhere is that posted?  \nMR. OTIS:  That would be posted on -- well, there -- \nthere are two pieces to this.  Post it on the State agency website, but \nthe -- the ITS is going to -- a State agency website or local agency \nwebsite they would post what they're using.  They would also post \ntheir impact assessments as well.  There's a different time frame for \neach. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Would it -- would a disclosure \nhave to be made, say, if a local government list -- had a listing on a \njob -- a third-party website like an Indeed.com?  Would there have to \nbe a disclosure that they were using this kind of decision-making tool \nin the process?  \nMR. OTIS:  Explain the scenario to me. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  There's a government job listing \nthat's on a third-party website.  Not directly through an agency or a \ndepartment, but it's on a third-party job website that's not maintained \nby a governmental entity.  Would that still require a disclosure?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n28MR. OTIS:  I think the answer is yes. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay. \nMR. OTIS:  I mean it -- it -- they're -- they're \ncontracting out with a third-party to do this, I would say the answer is \nyes.  But the primary purpose here is more the governmental entity is \nusing a tool, we want them to know what they're using.  We also want \nthe public to be able to say if you post and were using this tool, the \ntransparency part is there may be somebody out in the public that says, \nHey, you're using that tool  and call the State or local official and say, \nHey, that tool is very flawed.  Here's why you should reconsider using \nit.  So it actually is involving the public in some level of quality \ncontrol as it relates to this. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay, I was -- I -- I phrased my \nquestion a little poorly.  I don't mean jobs that are contracted out.  I \nmean, if say there's a clerk/typist position available for a local \ngovernment and they have it listed on their own website, the local \nmunicipality's website.  But they also have that listing on an \nIndeed.com.  So they have a job posting that would refer them over to \nthe website maybe to fill out the application, but on the listing it's the \njob posting itself where they're seeking resum\u00e9s. \nMR. OTIS:  I'm missing the AI piece of this. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  And the State or the municipality \nis using one of these tools in the ultimate decision-making process.  \nBecause from your answer on the disclosure earlier, I took it to mean \nthat if an AI decision-making tool is being used that they must \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n29disclose it on any job listings for that particular position.  Did -- did I \nhave that correct?  \nMR. OTIS:  I'm not -- I think that you're talking about \na different animal, so --  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So this is just disclosure \nto whom then?  If I could just move back.  \nMR. OTIS:  What this is is if you're a governmental \nentity and you're using an AI tool, you're going to have to list that \nyou're using -- list the tools you're using.  You're gonna have to list the \nassessment, although we have some redaction options --\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.\nMR. OTIS:  -- in sensitive situations and -- and things \nlike that.  So you may be talking about a different animal. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay, I misunderstood your \nanswer before.  So this is listing on the website, These are the tools we \nuse.  It's not specific to a certain job opening or anything like that. \nMR. OTIS:  Correct. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay, great.  Okay.  That was \nreally all the questions I had.  Thank you, Mr. Otis. \nMR. OTIS:  My pleasure. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Blumencranz. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Thank you.  Will the \nsponsor yield for some questions?  \nMR. OTIS:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n30yield?\nThe sponsor yields. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So just -- I guess last year \nand I guess this year with some amendments to it we looked at the \nLOADinG Act.  Can you talk about some differences to how some of \nthe parallel language here works versus within the LOADinG Act?  \nMR. OTIS:  Differences in?  \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  The way -- so both bills \ndeal with disclosure, correct, with the usage of artificial intelligence in \ngovernmental operations, correct?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, the only difference in the \nautomated decision-making tool definition is because last year's was \nrelated to employment decisions by State government, the word \n\"materially\" was used.  Really not appropriate in this broader bill \nwhich is asking for disclosure by State and local agency use of AI \ntools.  So the -- the definition is missing a word because it -- \n\"materially\" didn't apply to this bill. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  I -- I ask because that -- that \npiece --\nMR. OTIS:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  -- of legislation --   \nMR. OTIS:  Joke there, so... \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  This -- in this bill it doesn't \njust end at -- at State agencies.  This is local governments, BOCES, \nSUNY, CUNY, et cetera, all have to comply under this definition with \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n31this level of disclosure for automated decision-making usage within \ntheir respective town, village operations, correct?  \nMR. OTIS:  Yes, and I think that's a very positive \nthing.  I was a mayor for 12 years, and if I were a mayor now and my \nlocal government was to be using an AI tool, I want to make sure that \nwe have the protections, transparency in a place to make sure we \nknow what we're using and we're using it correctly, it doesn't include \nbias.  And so I think this is a -- a good assist to local government, \nschool districts, other entities. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So how are local school \ndistricts, A, gonna know about the need to now comply if they are \nusing artificial intelligence in some capacity in their decision-making; \nand B, what that compliance may look like for them under this \nlegislation?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, as with all legislation that the \nLegislature passes and the Governor signs, there follows up with \ncommunications about a new law is in place and -- and here's what \nyou would do to comply. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Now, there was concerns \nwith the LOADinG Act with similar language, similar compliance for \nState agencies.  That was amended after some consideration and \ndiscussions.  A lot of those considerations haven't necessarily been \ntaken in this form as far as that original language that was removed \nfrom the LOADinG Act is now here, not just for State agencies, but \nfor all governmental entities that would have to comply.  You don't \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n32think there will be an issue here, but when it came to the decision- \nmaking tools in hiring and firing, those considerations were -- were -- \nwere certainly there and were certainly removed from the legislation \nwe dealt with earlier this year. \nMR. OTIS:  I -- I don't agree with the assumption of \nyour question.  Having been very involved in the chapter amendment \nprocess on last year's bill, we're actually following the format for \nbroader uses, but the format of what we agreed to last year for \nemployment decisions only.  And so I -- I think it's sort of a -- a \ncomfortable move.  This is not last year's bill that -- pre-chapter \namendments.  This is similar in terms of what the -- the different \ndisclosures are, the different postings, the assessment, to what was \nagreed upon with the Governor's Office in the chapter amendments. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So you mentioned within \nthis bill performing any function.  So this legislation prohibits the use \nof automated decision-making in the absence of continued and \noperational meaningful human review in the performance of any \nfunction.  Does that seem to fall in line with your -- your \nunderstanding of the definition here?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, I -- I think that that language \nrelates to the principle that we it think that it would be good practice if \nyou're using an automated decision-making tool that -- that we \nmaintain human oversight and -- and contact with the operation of that \ntool.  So that's what that language is.  And that is a good practice with \nall the concerns that are raised around the world about the bad sides of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n33AI coupled with the good sides of AI.  The fact that we have \ncontinued human monitoring of what we're using is a positive thing \nand something we encourage, and that's what the language in the bill \nprovides. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  I don't mean to hone in on \nthis definition so much, but there are some important components that \nI think bring awareness to this question.  So we have numerous public \nassistance benefits programs here in New York State that could \nseriously and have seriously benefitted from the use of artificial \nintelligence systems making not consequential decisions, but making \ndecisions in the process to speed up the use of services.  You have \nSNAP, HEAP, temporary assistance, low-income household water \nassistance programs.  These programs sometimes have serious \nbacklogs.  Many of the members here have dealt with helping \nconstituents with these programs that have dealt with long wait lists \nand things that artificial intelligence making determinations as to how \nforms are correctly filled out and, you know, whether or not that can \napprove them for the next step, next level.  Will all of that be pulled \ninto question as something that can be advanced with new \ntechnologies with the passage of this legislation?  \nMR. OTIS:  Absolutely not.  And -- and so what this \nbill does is -- is really -- this is a quality control bill.  And so I would \n-- my belief is that the bill will actually help those kinds of functions \nproceed and advance them, and to make sure that they're used -- used \ncorrectly.   \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n34MR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So how will allowing a \nlevel of -- of red tape and compliance for local governments who are \njust trying to administer State programs, sometimes severely \nbacklogged, adding more work for them to create abilities for them to \ndo that work for the people faster?  How is that gonna make this an \neasier process for them?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, I -- I don't -- you had some nice \nchoices of pejorative words in there, red tape and -- and what like.  \nBut I -- I -- I -- I have a totally opposite take.  If -- if there are services \nand benefits that are being used today with the benefit of an AI \nsystem, don't we want to make sure that they're not -- that they're \nfunctioning correctly, they don't perpetuate bias, that they're -- they're \naccurate?  So this is -- this is -- it will advance the cause of using AI in \na positive way and provide the kind of quality control that -- whether \nyou're in the public sector or whether you're in the private sector.  If \nyou're a private company and you're using AI tools, you should want \nto make sure that they function the way that are intended.  That you \nare monitoring how they function to make sure they continue to \nfunction the way that the company intends it to be used, and -- and to \nbe able to pivot when you find out that it's not happening as intended.  \nI think here in New York State, around the country and around the \nworld, this is the test to make sure that AI is used appropriately as \nopposed to be used in a way that -- that could be reckless and -- and \ndamaging. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So who bears the cost of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n35the implementation of this bill?  Are there corresponding applications \n-- appropriations, rather, for school districts, for counties, for towns, \nfor villages.  I know you were a mayor.  You receive a compliance \nburden like this, you're gonna need to find an individual or an \norganization that can help you create that level of reporting that needs \nto be provided to the Legislature.  Unless you have someone on hand \nyou're gonna need to hire someone who can then meet that standard \nand -- and write that report to understand that they're ethically \nimplementing this in a way that meets the standard of the law.  Who's \ngonna -- who's gonna help this compliance move forward for towns \nand villages that may not have the -- the expertise needed to comply?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, a two-part answer to your question.  \nPart number one is that if you're gonna use an AI tool, you should also \nassume the responsibility of using it correctly and competently and \nwith the quality control.  So it -- it sort of comes with the package.  Is \nthere an appropriation here?  There is not.  My assumption is, and it is \nalready the case that there are folks out there that build -- that have \nbuilt up an expertise on how to do this kind of monitoring and that \nthat -- that world is gonna grow.  That's a -- a big growth area in terms \nof employment, what people are going to school for, in technology.  \nBut if you can't afford to make sure you're gonna to maintain quality \ncontrol, you shouldn't be doing -- using the tool to begin with. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So you're saying that if a -- \na county, maybe a county that is not sufficiently provided the funding \nthey need does -- and those may be very well the same counties that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n36have significant backlogs in providing services.  Because they're a \ncounty that is in severe need, they would be at a disadvantage of a \ncounty that would have the ability to speed up their processes because \nthey could afford to hire compliance officers to make sure they can \nmeet the mandate of the law. \nMR. OTIS:  Well, again, these tools can have positive \nor negative consequences.  Our first -- first priority is to make sure we \nhave quality.  I'd say more broadly I am a big supporter of AIM \nfunding and funding for local governments of all levels in a wide \nvariety of ways, and school districts.  And so I think we can all -- I'd \nbe happy to advocate for additional funding to help everybody with \ntheir technology advances.  We actually did this a number of years ago \nwith the Smart Schools Bond Act to help school districts with their \ntechnology purchases.  So I think the State should continue to be in \nthat game of providing additional financial assistance as it relates to \ntechnology needs of school districts, local government, counties \nthroughout. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  All right.  Thank you very \nmuch.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  This bill, like many of the \nother ones that have seeked [sic] to create guardrails for our local \ngovernment, for our State government, for our school districts, for our \nBOCES systems; systems that often could really use a hand in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n37providing services, in providing many of our essential State services \nthat they have to assist in giving members of the community who are \nin need, whether it's SNAP, whether it's temporary assistance, whether \nit's the EBT program.  So there's the housing programs that face \nsevere backlogs.  Many of these programs could really benefit from \nthe usage and implementation of artificial intelligence systems of \nsoftwares [sic] that could help makes those decisions happen faster.  \nMake sure services can reach individuals faster.  When we create \nguardrails like this, ones that would inherently need a level of \nexpertise at every level of government in the State of New York, it \nwould necessarily create a world in which New York would fall \nbehind other states in the way that they can provide services faster, in \nthe way they can provide decisions.  Not large decisions, not \nfundamental decisions, make-or-break decisions.  That's not what \nwe're saying we don't want here.  But what we do want is to make sure \nthat small decisions that might take weeks for a human to implement a \ndecision on versus a -- a computer system that can say, This form is \nincorrectly filled out.  Please send it back and come back to me  within \nthe same few minutes could really help deal with a divide we're facing \nwhen it comes to providing services in different communities.  \nSo I -- I strongly urge, like the LOADinG Act, we go \nback to the drawing board and make sure we narrow the scope on \nwhat is needed from these local communities, what red tape is built up \naround them, and we come back with a version that makes sense for \nfinal decision-making, but not for all decision-making in these \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n38processes.\nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Hevesi. \nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I would \nlike to call Rules in the Speaker's Conference Room. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  Rules \nto the Speaker's Conference Room.  Rules Committee members to the \nSpeaker's Conference Room.  \nRead the last section. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)\nMr. Otis to explain his vote. \nMR. OTIS:  Very briefly.  This is an important step \nfor New York State and it's an important signal to other states around \nthe country that for governmental uses of AI, transparency, disclosure \nimpact assessments and guidance from their technology team -- and \nwe have the Office of Technology Services which is part of this bill -- \nis available to State agencies to make sure they get this right.  An \nimportant bill.  Pleased to see great support for this here today, \nsupport for the other House last week. \nI vote aye. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Otis in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n39affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

An act to amend the Social Services Law, in \nrelation to the administration of the Statewide Central Register of \nChild Abuse and Maltreatment.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Mr. \nHevesi, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced. \nAn explanation has been requested.\nMr. Hevesi. \nMR. HEVESI:  Good afternoon, Madam Speaker.  \nGood afternoon, my colleagues and Ms. Walsh. \nThis bill will alter the current system of reporting \nabuse and neglect to the State Central Register from an anonymous \nreporting system to a semi-confidential reporting system. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield? \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n40ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And thank you for the brief \nexplanation.  I want -- I want you to give a little bit more of an \nexplanation as to why because right -- let's talk about right now.  The \ncurrent -- the current law says that if somebody calls the State Central \nRegistry with concerns and they want to -- they want to make a report, \nthey do not need to leave their name or any contact information, \ncorrect?  \nMR. HEVESI:  That's correct. \nMS. WALSH:  And what's the reason for that current \nlaw?  \nMR. HEVESI:  That's the way the law was written.  \nThat's the way most laws were written back in the day.  But what \nwe're seeing now is a trend where states, including ours, is gonna be \nmoving away from an anonymous reporting system because -- for a \nvariety of reasons I can get to -- but the latest state to do this was \nTexas in 2023.  The Republican-led Legislature passed this in 2023.  \nCalifornia did it last year.  And related to the Texas implementation, \nwe have a professor at NYU who I trust implicitly did -- implicitly, \ndid an analysis of Texas and showed that there will be no -- no more \nrisk to children's safety. \nMS. WALSH:  That's interesting.  Well, we will get \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n41into that.  I -- because I really do disagree with that. \nMR. HEVESI:  Okay. \nMS. WALSH:  So -- but the -- the idea was that it \nmight -- there might be a chilling effect on people who have real \nconcerns about a child or about a family situation, and if they -- if they \nhave to give their name and contact information in order to have the \ncomplaint actually investigated or the hotline be investigated, that they \nmight not make that call. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.  And that is an absolutely \nlegitimate concern.  It was the reason why I didn't move the bill last \nyear.  It was actually on the floor last year.  Can I -- can I give a little \ncontext?  Because I know you know this.  Just for my colleagues. \nMS. WALSH:  Sure.  Yeah.  We've got plenty of \ntime. \nMR. HEVESI:  I'll do it -- I'll do it quickly for my \ncolleagues.\nMS. WALSH:  No, no.  Take your time.\nMR. HEVESI:  Take your time?  Thanks, fellas.\n(Laughter)\nMS. WALSH:  We've got a half-hour.  We're good.  \nMR. HEVESI:  So what we're talking about, the State \nCentral Registry of Child Abuse [sic], about 150 calls to the State \nCentral Registry annually.  Thirty percent of those are indicate -- \nwound up being indicated cases, meaning there's substantial enough \nevidence for those calls to have come in and then to be investigated \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n42and pursued.  There's another portion, and -- and the overwhelming \nmajority -- excuse me, the overwhelming majority of those calls come \nfrom mandated reporters.  Mandated reporters are required by law to \nleave their name and number.  Then there's a smaller portion of callers \nwho call in voluntarily, and then there's a very small portion from \nanonymous reporters that say it's about 7 percent of the annual calls.\nMS. WALSH:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. HEVESI:  Now, it's those anonymous calls -- \ncalls that we're having real trouble with, and I can tell you why. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, I mean, I could tell you why.  I \nmean --  \nMR. HEVESI:  Go ahead.\nMS. WALSH:  -- from -- from -- I mean, I think part \nof the problem is you get two parents who are warring with each other \nand you get one parent that's ratting out and calling in fake hotline \nreports --\nMR. HEVESI:  Yes.\nMS. WALSH:  -- to try to harass and annoy the other \nparty.  I mean, that's what happens.  And so -- but my concern is -- I \nmean, just to get to the heart of it, I mean, I appreciate that you have \nstatistics, but our kids aren't statistics.  I mean, we're -- I would say \njust as we require 12 jurors to convict somebody, I mean, I -- I worry \n-- you know, that one holdout I think is important.\nMR. HEVESI:  It is.\nMS. WALSH:  And I think in this area what I'm \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n43concerned about is what if you have -- what if you have a \nneighborhood and you have a family living in one house and the \nneighbor, the next door neighbor has got real concerns.  But they -- \nregardless of what happens with the investigation, if their information \ngets out that they were the ones who called, it's gonna make their lives \nmiserable --  \nMR. HEVESI:  It could be dangerous.\nMS. WALSH:  -- miserable living next-door to that \nfamily if they call in.  So that's why we have confidentiality, because \nwe want that neighbor who has real concerns to call in and not be \nworried about their name getting out.  Because before you know it, \nthings -- you know, the -- the retribution against people who make a \nvery legitimate concerned call is -- is a risk.  And that's why we had \nrules about why there's confidentiality to begin with.  It wasn't just \nthat we wanted some outmoded system, it's that we want to be sure \nthat even if there's a hundred calls and out of those hundred calls \nthere's one call of abuse, a hotline for abuse, and we want everything \nto be investigated, and if that person is not gonna call if they can't be \nguaranteed anonymity, then we're not gonna know about that hotline.  \nWe're not gonna be able to investigate that, and we're gonna have a \nkid that's potentially gonna get killed or injured by -- by the person.  \nSo that's the -- that's the risk.  That's the concern. \nMR. HEVESI:  Can I address that specifically?\nMS. WALSH:  Absolutely.  Please do.\nMR. HEVESI:  So first, I absolutely share that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n44concern.  And that's why legislating this area is -- is hypersensitive.  \nSo here's what we've done.  One, we made sure to -- number one, \nthere is no empirical data that anonymous reporting is keeping kids \nsafe.  And I've been at this for four or five years now.  That's number \none.  Number two, these calls, okay, do a number of things.  There are \n10,000 New York families that find out that they have been wrongly \naccused and investigated based off of these anonymous calls, and \nthere are consequences to that for those families.  So just so we \nunderstand what we're clearing.  If somebody calls in an anonymous \nreport on your family, that allows the Child Services investigation to \nopen.  They are allowed to do a number of things.  And I would ask \nmy colleagues who are listening, think about this if this was \nhappening to your family.  And I'll get back to the -- to the risk to the \nother abuse.  So the investigation's open.  They are allowed to come to \nyour house any time.  They usually come at night.  They will search \neverything.  They will ask sometimes, frequently, your child to take \ntheir clothes off to make sure that there's no abuse.  Then they will \ncontact the child's school.  They will contact your neighbors.  They \nwill contact your doctor.  All with the threat that your family could be \nseparated.  Okay?  So that's 10,000 innocent families a year who are \nbeing traumatized.  Add that to the fact that this has become a way for \ndomestic violence abusers who -- and I keep having this image of a \nvery brave young lady who stands up to her abuser and the abuser \n[sic] kicks him out, finally gets rid of this guy and she's with her kid, \nand the abuser is able to, because we have anonymous reporting, be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n45shielded from what I would say is the equivalent of a hand grenade, \ndrops it into that family and, boom, now you're questioned as a parent.  \nNow everybody knows you're questioned as a parent.  Now your kid is \nunder separation anxiety and trauma.  So we don't want that.  Plus, \nthis system, the entire system, and I got to believe the anonymous \nreporting portion is unbelievably racist.  So right now if you are a \nBlack family you are seven times more likely to get an indicated case.  \nYou are eight -- I'm sorry, you are seven times more likely to have a \nreport against you.  You're eight times more likely to have an \nindicated case, and you are 11 times more likely to have your family \nseparated.  For Latinx families it's about 5 percent.  So what we've \nallowed here -- \nMS. WALSH:  How is that racist?  \nMR. HEVESI:  How is that racist? \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  I mean, if somebody makes a \nphone call and -- and hotlines something to the State Central Registry, \nI mean, that's anybody, White, Black, can call.  They investigate every \nhotline --\nMR. HEVESI:  They do, and that's the problem.\nMS. WALSH:  So how is that racial?  \nMR. HEVESI:  It's racial because the proportion of \nthe calls to the population is so out of proportion that it can't be \nwithout racial bias getting these numbers.  It is impossible.  But that's \nnot even the point of the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  But you're not saying -- you're not \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n46saying that CPS is selectively --\nMR. HEVESI:  No.  I'm saying --\nMS. WALSH:  I mean, they're -- they're investigating \nevery complaint that comes in. \nMR. HEVESI:  As -- as they should.\nMS. WALSH:  Right.  As they should.\nMR. HEVESI:  What I'm suggesting -- what I'm \nsuggesting is by relieving, as we have now, an anonymous system, any \nconsequences for the reporter who are -- and we're going after \nmalicious calls and intentionally false calls, without any consequences \nto them.  What we have allowed is a system that has perpetuated \nracism, domestic violence and other types of harassment. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So since you just -- since you \njust said that, let me say this:  I would love to work with you on that \nbill.\nMR. HEVESI:  Which one?\nMS. WALSH:  That bill to actually penalize people \nwho are repeatedly making harassing, unsubstantiated hotlined. \nMR. HEVESI:  I -- I do --\nMS. WALSH:  Do that!\nMR. HEVESI:  And can I tell you something -- \nsomething important --\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMR. HEVESI:  -- about this bill?  And I had a -- a \nconversation with one of your colleagues in Children and Families \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n47about this issue, about this not being prosecuted.  So the District \nAttorneys Association tells us that they're not prosecuting these for a \nvariety of reasons.  The biggest reason, I would believe, is because \nthey're anonymous.  So by voting for this bill, that means that we're \ngonna have the name and contact information of anybody who calls in \na false report.  You're actually putting teeth into the system by voting \nfor this bill. \nMS. WALSH:  Well I'm telling you as somebody that \nhas practiced in family court that when we look at the case notes of \ninvestigations and we look at the wording of -- of what the hotline \nwas, we -- I would say 98 percent of the time -- and that's just my \nmade-up statistic -- but 98 percent of the time we know -- we know \nwho made it, right?  We know who made it.\nMR. HEVESI:  Right.\nMS. WALSH:  And if it's the other -- because the \nother parent or whoever it is that's made this bogus call, it could be a \ngrandparent, it could be somebody else that just wants to get \nsomebody into trouble, we know who it is.  We know who it is.\nMR. HEVESI:  Okay.\nMS. WALSH:  But you know what, the family court \ndoesn't have the power right now to come back in and say to that other \nparent, Hey, you know what?  We know it was you.  You've been \ncalling 10 , 15 times.  We don't want -- you know, we're gonna have \nsome teeth in this to be able to say -- you know, to do something with \nyou.  We don't have that right now. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n48MR. HEVESI:  I'm -- I'm interested in this issue.  \nLet's -- let's talk about it offline after Session.\nMS. WALSH:  Absolutely.\nMR. HEVESI:  This is a problem I don't like as well. \nMS. WALSH:  But -- but let's just talk about for -- for \n-- like you said, for colleagues that maybe don't know, how this -- how \nthis bill works.  So you -- you call -- say you have somebody that -- \ntake -- use my example, then, of you have a neighbor that goes in -- or \nmakes the call and says, I have some real concerns.  I've heard \nscreaming.  I've heard whatever.  I'm -- I'm concerned about this child \nthat lives next door.  I've seen this child.  They look -- they look like \nthey are disheveled.  They look like they are very upset.  I've observed \nthem.  Whatever, whatever the reasons are.  And then the person at the \nother end of that phone line is gonna say, Great.  Well , what's your \nname and what's your contact information , and they say, Oh, wait a \nminute.  I don't want to give you that, and then what happens?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Perfect -- perfect setup.  \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. HEVESI:  Then what happens is if they -- well, \nfirst of all, if they don't give their name and contact information, \nOCFS is prohibited from transmitting a report to the appropriate local \nsocial services district.  Then if that person says no, they will be \nforwarded to a supervisor.  This is the new amendment.  This is what \nwe added this year as opposed to last year out of an abundance of \ncaution, even though we believe if we did straight anonymous \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n49reporting, kids would be safe.  So they will be forwarded to a \nsupervisor.  The supervisor is gonna go through a couple of things; \nnumber one, the confidential -- confidentiality protection is already in \nthe law.  We'll take you through how in practice and in the law that we \ndon't disclose those informations.  Even practitioners watch in the \nsystem. \nMS. WALSH:  So it gets kicked up to a supervisor.  \nThe supervisor tries to reassure the caller --\nMR. HEVESI:  That's number one, yes.\nMS. WALSH:  -- don't worry about it. \nMR. HEVESI:  That's correct.\nMS. WALSH:  Yep.\nMR. HEVESI:  So you're confidential.  Number two, \nif the person insists that they have to make an anonymous call, the \nsupervisor will tell them to call 911.  They will take your immediate \ncomplaint and deal with it anonymously.  And then the final thing, in \nan effort to deal with not abuse, but neglect which could be \nmaltreatment, we're gonna have the supervisor refer them to the \nHEARS community service line, which stands for Help, Empower, \nAdvocate, Reassure and Support, where caring representatives are \ngonna guide families to services including food, clothing, housing, \nmedical and behavioral health, parenting and child care in 12 different \nlanguages.  So what we're trying to do is -- and you're right to be \nconcerned about this Ms. Walsh, and I share that same concern which \nis why this bill sat for a year on the floor without being moved out of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n50an abundance of caution by us and Counsel.  We don't wanna have a \nchilling effect on people making phone calls, particularly kids.  And \nwe think that this bill strikes the balance of being overcautious as we \nchange away from a system that we know is hurting tens of thousands \nof families annually. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So let's just -- let's just finish \nup, though, with this part and then I probably -- that probably will be \nthe end of it for me in terms of my questioning for you. \nSo after it gets kicked up to the -- the next level, \nright, and they -- they reassure the person, that person still says, I -- I \njust do not feel comfortable with this.  I don't want to call the HEARS \nline.  I don't wanna -- I want to report what I'm seeing, but I do not \nwant my name or identity to be known in any way .  Then is there any \nrequirement to forward that -- that concern and hotline to be \ninvestigated?  \nMR. HEVESI:  No. \nMS. WALSH:  And that is my problem with the bill.\nMR. HEVESI:  Okay.\nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much, Mr. Hevesi.\nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you.\nMS. WALSH:  Mr. -- or Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  I don't care if I'm the only no vote in \nthis House.  I will not support this.  I think that there is a very, very \ngood reason why the law exists the way it does, and it's because abuse \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n51and neglect is not always obvious.  Sometimes we -- we would have a \nnumber of people call in and hotline the same thing, right?  \nSometimes you have mandated reporters like -- like teachers or \ndoctors who are concerned about a child and they'll make a phone \ncall.  I'm concerned about -- I'm concerned about the neighbor.  I'm \nconcerned about other people that are not mandated reporters but have \nseen or heard or observed something that really is concerning.  It \ncould be abuse and neglect.  We have all, in our districts, I am sure, I \nknow I have, had situations where you pick up the paper and you see \nthat a child has been killed, has been killed, and everyone says, Oh, \nCPS must have drop ped the ball.  They must not have done what they \nwere supposed to have done .  And you know what?  They can't \ninvestigate something unless that hotline is relayed to them for \ninvestigation.  And so this bill, what this does is it says that unless the \nperson calling, despite reassurances from upper levels of management \nwithin the -- the State Central Registry, if they still say, No.  I -- if you \nare gonna use my name or -- or if my name has to be given, I -- I will \nnot -- I will not -- I will not give this to you, they have no obligation.  \nThey will not refer that hotline and that concern to be investigated.  \nAnd, my colleagues, that is dangerous.  And I -- I heard a bunch of \nstatistics from the sponsor.  I'm telling you that I -- I don't care if it's 1 \npercent.  I -- I don't care.  We -- yes, yes.  The hotline procedure does \nresult at times in harassing calls being made one against another or if \nyou have parents who are warring.  Yes, that does occur.  Or from \ngrandparents who are taking a side with one child or the -- or one \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n52parent or the other parent.  It does happen.  Of course it does happen.  \nBut -- and I'd like to continue to use my second 15, please.  Thank \nyou.  But I think that that gets sorted out within the family court \nsystem.  That gets sorted out.  We know, we know when we read those \ncase notes, even though they're redacted.  We can suspect because \nwe're working with both of those parents.  If the -- the actual -- the -- \nthe way that the hotline is taken has direct quotes that sound like one \nof the parents that uses words or bad grammar or whatever that \nidentifies them, and -- and you know, and you know who made that \ncall.  I would like to be able to empower family court to be able to \ntake some action when it's been used and in an -- used as a sword, \nreally, against the other parent.  I would love to do that bill, and I \nthink that other family court attorneys and judges would love to see \nthat bill.  Because is it -- can it be used at times in a domestic violence \nsituation?  Yes, it can.  Do we wanna avoid that?  Yes, we do.  But we \ndon't wanna do this bill.  We don't wanna do this bill because it's \ngoing to chill really important reporting.  And even if that only occurs \nin X percent of the time, as has been surveyed, I don't care.  I still \nthink we don't wanna change the law to do that.\nSo I -- I will be a no on this, and I really do hope that \nthere will be some other nos in this Chamber about it as well.  I think \nthat this is -- this is not a good idea.  I will not agree to this as a -- as a \npoint of policy.  So thank you very much, Madam Speaker, for the \nopportunity.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n53section.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh.  \nMS.

GIGLIO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I \ncouldn't agree with my colleague more in that every child and every \ncomplaint of abuse or neglect should be investigated.  There are \nteachers, there are camp instructors.  There are people that are afraid \nof losing heir jobs if their name is on a complaint reporting abuse.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n54And children are a vulnerable population that cannot speak for \nthemselves, and every single -- every single complaint for a child that \nhas been abused or neglected needs to be investigated, whether or not \nthe people want to be anonymous or not.  \nSo I agree with my colleague and I will be voting in \nthe negative and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.  We \nneed to protect children in this State.  And there is no waiver just \nbecause somebody doesn't want to announce who made the complaint.  \nThey should all be investigated.\nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Giglio in the \nnegative. \nMr. Hevesi to explain his vote. \nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  And \nthank you to my colleagues.  I appreciate all of the -- the concern on \nboth sides of the aisle.  I really do.  This is a tough bill, so I \nunderstand the votes.  I do wanna reassure my colleagues that I \nwouldn't put this forward if I didn't think the safety of children was \nparamount.  But the reason why I wanted to rise very quickly, I don't \ndo this often, but I want to thank the Speaker, to start with.  I -- I think \nit's important that all of us remember that when you have a Speaker \nwho's trying to get to the answer of yes, that's a big difference for \neverybody else in the House.  Also, thank you to Jen Best, Janice \nNieves, Paolo Musto and Michael Hegarty; all of the staff here for \ntheir caring and their guidance.  To Joyce McMillan, Angela Burton \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n55and Chris Gottlieb who guided this process through.  And then last \nand finally, this is the most important to me, this past Friday my \nChief-of-Staff, Alexa Arecchi, who has been working with me for \neight years has moved on.  She's beyond me, grown beyond me.  She \nis like a -- like a sister to me.  I think she's fantastic.  Nothing we \ncould have accomplished over the last eight years without her.  This \nbill and all the other great work for the people of my district, to her I \njust wanted to say on the record, Lex, you're the greatest and we will \nmiss you terribly. \nThank you.  I vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Hevesi in the \naffirmative.  \nMs. Walsh to explain her vote. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nConfidential reporting of hotlines to the State Central Registry is the \nabsolute basis and, like, lynchpin of -- of what Child Protective \nServices is supposed to be about.  I want to impress upon my \ncolleagues that this bill turns it right on its head.  And I -- I was \ndistraught last year when I thought that this bill was gonna -- was \ngonna come up and come to the floor, and when it didn't I breathed a \nhuge sigh of relief.  But here we are this year.  I -- I really -- I implore \na second look at this -- at this bill.  This is misguided.  It is absolutely \nmisguided.\nI will be voting no and I really do hope that \nsomebody after this vote really takes a hard look at it and thinks -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n56thinks about it.  I don't see -- you know, I -- the New York Public \nWelfare Association, you don't see them in support of this.  They're \nthe people that -- I went to all the trainings when I was working as an \nassistant county attorney working with CPS and foster care.  They did \nall the trainings for us.  They're not in favor of this.  The family court \njudges I've spoken with are not in favor of this.  And certainly, the -- \nyou know, the case workers that -- you'd think that they would be \ndelighted with this bill because it would mean that they wouldn't have \nto investigate as much stuff.  They wouldn't be so overworked.  \nThey're not in favor of this either.  So think about it.  What are you -- \nwho are you doing this bill for?  \nThis is not a good idea.  I'll be obviously voting in the \nnegative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMs. Walsh in the negative. \nMr. Meeks to explain his vote. \nMR. MEEKS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for an \nopportunity to explain my vote.  I want to commend the sponsor of \nthis needed legislation.  This is an effort to right historic wrongs.  But \nit also protects those who are in need.  As it relate [sic] to \nconfidentiality, it still maintains the confidentiality from the public as \nwell as the person accused of abuse or neglect.  However, it gives \nthose who are doing these investigations further tools to reach out to \nthe individual who made such a call, to follow up with them and find \nout their concerns.  Also, it would help them to sort of tread through \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n57challenges such as one of my colleagues across the aisle mentioned, as \nbad grammar.  They can actually reach out to an individual and find \nout what was the premise behind their call, recognizing cultural \ndifferences as well as cultural sensitivity.\nSo I commend the sponsor on this legislation and I \nwill be voting in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Meeks in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Meeks in the \naffirmative.\nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Madam Speaker, \nmembers have on their desk an A-Calendar.  I'd like to move to \nadvance that A-Calendar. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On Mrs. Peoples- \nStokes' motion, the A-Calendar is advanced. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you.  If we could \ngo directly to that A-Calendar on page 20 and take up Rules Report \nNo. 852 by Ms. Simon.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n58ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Page 20, Rules \nReport No. 852, the Clerk will read.\nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A08888, Rules Report \nNo. 852, Simon, Shimsky, Stirpe, Shrestha, Gallagher, Mitaynes, \nRosenthal, Paulin, Reyes, Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas, Davila, Otis, Kelles, \nSchiavoni, Jacobson, Romero, R. Carroll.  An act to amend the Public \nService Law, in relation to the provision of gas service to new \ncustomers.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Ms. \nSimon, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced. \nAn explanation has been requested.  \nMs. Simon.  \nMS. SIMON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  This bill \nwould remove the 100-foot rule for residential properties.  The \n100-foot rule requires gas utilities to subsidize using ratepayer money \nthe first 100 feet of pipe to connect to a new residential building to the \ngas system.  Changing this law would allow those requesting that \nnatural gas to pay the true costs to install natural gas in a new \nconstruction and end the ratepayer-funded subsidy, saving gas \ncustomers money on their bills every month and letting the true costs \nof installing a new gas infrastructure control the market. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Lemondes.\nMR. LEMONDES:  Madam Speaker, will the \nsponsor yield?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n59ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMS. SIMON:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. LEMONDES:  Could you just simply cover why \nwe think this is beneficial, what -- what exactly the intent of -- of the \nbill's accomplishments will be?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well right now to connect to a new gas \nline, not to connect to get your name on a new bill, but new service, it \n-- the cost of doing that if you are within 100 feet of the gas line is \npaid for by all of us.  Under this bill, the person who is requesting that \nconnection pays for their own connection.  If they were 110 feet away \nfrom the gas line, they'd be paying for that connection.  It's cheaper \nwithin 100 feet, and that's what they would be paying for themselves.  \nMR. LEMONDES:  Okay.  So -- and what would the \napproximate cost of that be, and would it be the same throughout the \nState?  \nMS. SIMON:  No.  In fact, it would be different \ndepending on where you are located, the utility itself, and that varies \naround the State as well. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Okay.  And so, in general, do \nthink that -- how -- how many people would this impact, roughly, \nStatewide?  \nMS. SIMON:  The number of people?\nMR. LEMONDES:  Oh, I -- I mean --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n60MS. SIMON:  It would be -- I -- I would say it's every \ngas customer ratepayer is affected at some level because they're saving \nsome money.  But it is -- it is estimated that about -- the ratepayers, \noverall, right, New York State ratepayers, would save about $200 \nmillion a year. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  I \nappreciate your question -- I appreciate your answers.\nAnd, Madam Speaker, on the bill.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. LEMONDES:  So, I -- I'm not sure how much \nthis would actually benefit ratepayers, and because of that I would say \nthat without knowing the true benefit and the true costs, as with \nanything with respect to energy, I would -- I would say that I could not \nendorse this bill yet in its current form. \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Palmesano. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWill the sponsor yield for some questions? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Thank you, Ms. Simon.  \nJust for the record, this bill is specifically for \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n61residential customers; is that correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes, it is residential customers current \n-- because that is in our laws.  If -- if it's a commercial customer, it's a \nmatter of regulation by the PSC.  And so there's no need to pass a law \nabout that. \nMR. PALMESANO:  How does this -- how would \nthis bill handle mixed-use property?  We've seen how many residential \nand commercial.  How would that work?  Who would be responsible \nfor the residential homeowner or the commercial developer?  How \nwould that work?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, if you're building a new \nbuilding, is that what you're talking about? \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yeah, sure.\nMS. SIMON:  Okay.  So, under the All-Electric \nBuildings Act, most of those new buildings would need to be electric \nanyway after December 31, 2025.  And so in realty, if somebody is \nlooking to build and start a -- a building next year, they would have to \nmake it electric anyway. \nMR. PALMESANO:  So this bill continues the \nsubsidy for electric hookups, correct?\nMS. SIMON:  Yes.  In fact, the -- the electric subsidy \nis, A, much cheaper and, by the way, it's a matter of public policy.  \nPeople absolutely have to have electricity; they don't have to have gas.  \nIn fact, renewable energy is already cheaper to install and more \nefficient. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n62MR. PALMESANO:  So you think elec -- heating \nwith electric is cheaper than heating with gas?  \nMS. SIMON:  Especially if it's renewable electric, \nwhich is what the All-Electric Buildings Act would require. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Because I was gonna ask you, \ndo you have an idea how much it costs to heat a home with all electric \nin Buffalo or the North Country?  It's pretty expensive.\nMS. SIMON:  That is going to depend on the home, \nthe size of the home, Whether or not it is properly insulated, et cetera, \net cetera.  So all of those things are things that are going to vary.  But \nwe know that ratepayers who are currently subsiding this for their \nneighbors will save $200 million this year. \nMR. PALMESANO:  So I know the argument on \nyour side is it saves ratepayer money.\nMS. SIMON:  Mm-hmm.  It does.\nMR. PALMESANO:  So let's say, for example, \nsomeone signs off and they get on and they get the 100-foot rule and \nthey get on the system.  Now you have multiple -- more people on the \n-- the gas system.  So when you have those new customers come in, \nthey help pay the fixed operation and capital costs, correct?  When \nthey come on, they help share those costs that the ratepayers are \npaying, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  I'm not sure I understand your \nquestion. \nMR. PALMESANO:  I'll rephrase it. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n63MS. SIMON:  Please. \nMR. PALMESANO:  So when you have a new \ncustomer come on -- on the gas system, now you have the existing \ncustomers who were there before that.  They're paying fixed \noperational and capital costs on the system, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, all ratepayers are paying and \nsubsiding the utility to provide its service.  But, the difference here \nbetween I believe your question and what this bill does is that this bill \nonly affects new connections.  So if you move a couple of blocks \naway and you -- you call up your -- your utility and you say, I just \nmoved.  I need service at my new place, and your -- the new building \nthat you are in, or the newer-to-you building that you're in, already has \na connection, there's no cost.  It's just you're changing your service.  \nThat's not affected by this. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  \nAccording to pipeline contractors and unions, the \nelimination of the 100-foot rule in this legislation will cost thousands \nof union and non-worker -- workers doing -- doing their jobs.  Do you \nhave any concern for these workers or their families which this bill \nwill put on the unemployment line, or you don't think that's gonna \nhave an impact on them?  \nMS. SIMON:  Actually, I think they are worried \nabout something that isn't, in fact, the case.  I do worry about workers.  \nI do worry about their families.  I do worry about their health and the \nhealth of our climate as well.  In fact, there's no -- there's no evidence \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n64to suggest that they will be losing jobs because, number one, if \nsomeone is installing new gas, they're installing new gas.  The laying \nof additional gas pipes is more affected by the CLCPA than -- it's not \nat all affected by this bill.  So I don't actually think that that's a -- a \nconcern that they need to have. \nMR. PALMESANO:  So I know I'm kind of bouncing \naround a little bit here.  So this only affects residential.\nMS. SIMON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. PALMESANO:  So commercial would still get \nthe subsidy, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  Commercial still does.  And it matters \n-- I said a -- that's a matter of regulation, that's not a matter of law. \nMR. PALMESANO:  I'm sorry.  What was that last \npart?  \nMS. SIMON:  That's a matter of regulation.  The PSC \ncould change it tomorrow anyway. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes.\nDo you have any idea how much this is gonna impact \na -- a cust -- a new homeowner in costs?  In some estimates we've \nseen tens of thousands of dollars. \nMS. SIMON:  Could you please repeat --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes.  Do you --\nMS. SIMON:  I didn't quite hear what you said.  \nMR. PALMESANO:  Do -- do you have any idea \nhow much this will cost new customers, because if they have to pay \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n65for this hookup on their own.  Wouldn't that additional cost be \nsomewhere in the neighborhood -- it's more than $5-, $10,000 for \nhookups to do those hookups in their home?  Won't that increase the \nprice of homes? \nMS. SIMON:  Well, if -- if you -- if you are putting \nup a new home, you should pay for the connection.  That's all this \nsays.  And the connection, by the way, should be paid for by the \nperson who's putting it in instead of your neighbors, which is not a \ngood way to get off on the right foot with your neighbors, I might say.  \nBut the reality is that it's not going to affect most people unless you \nare putting in a new connection.  And if you're converting, let's say, \nfrom oil to natural gas, that's a big expensive job anyway.  Now, the \ncost will vary.  It's cheaper the closer you are to a pipeline, more \nexpensive if you're farther away.  So that's gonna be a different cost \nanyway.  And if you were putting in this new line and it was 101 feet \naway from the gas line, you would be paying the full cost anyway.  \nThis doesn't change that. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  \nI want to talk about reliability.  NYISO came out with \na report last -- two weeks ago talking about thinness in the reliability \nof the grid.  Specifically they cited the need to possibly bring back \nshuttered power plants, shuttered fossil fuel power plants and that \neverything needs to be on the table.  Isn't this gonna jeopardize  the \nability to have opportunity for reliable natural gas and it's gonna cost \nmore for homeowners, new people?  But again, I will still argue and I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n66will argue later that it's saving the customers because they're on the \nsystem, so they're sub -- they're sharing in that cost.  Now that cost \nwill be borne by fewer people with your bill.\nMS. SIMON:  No, that's not true at all.  This is just \nsaying if you put in a new connection, you pay for it.  That's all it says. \nMR. PALMESANO:  And remind me the reason \nagain why electric is okay but not gas.  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, first of all, it's cheaper, number \none. \nMR. PALMESANO:  It's not, but that's okay.  \nMS. SIMON:  And number two, I'm sorry? \nMR. PALMESANO:  Sorry.\nMS. SIMON:  Okay.  It -- it -- number one, the other \nthing as a matter of policy and a matter of safety, you need electricity.  \nEverybody needs electricity, everybody doesn't need gas.  And in fact, \nmany, many renewable systems are just as reliable, just as much more \nsafe for everyone and are cheaper and much more efficient.  So if you \nhave a heat pump that is providing heat or cooling and we have a big \nproblem in the summer now because the peaks happens in the \nsummer.  If they're doing that with a heat pump, it's much more \nreliable, much more efficient and therefore cheaper. \nMR. PALMESANO:  You think a -- you think a heat \npump's a more reliable power energy for heat than a -- a traditional \nnatural gas boiler or furnace?  \n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n67MS. SIMON:  Well, first of all, that is not a relevant \ntopic to this bill.  All this bill says is -- \nMR. PALMESANO:  I think it is. \nMS. SIMON:  -- you -- it is not.  If you decide to put \nin a new gas connection and you're a residential customer, you and I \ndon't pay for that person to do it, they pay for it themselves. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Isn't it really your desire with \nthis bill and bills like it, you want -- isn't -- doesn't the Majority -- you \n-- you want people off natural gas and you want them on full electric, \nright?  Isn't that the goal?  \nMS. SIMON:  We have a climate leadership and \ncommunity protection act and a State climate pan -- plan.  The fact is, \ngetting off fossil fuels is safer and healthier for everybody.  This is \nonly that -- that policy makes is -- is good for -- for children and other \nliving things.  So, this is not inconsistent with that policy, but doesn't \nin fact take anybody off of fossil fuels.  Right now they would have -- \nthey -- they don't have a choice.  They would have that choice if they \ndecide -- let's say they decide to put in a new connection to gas and \nthey say, you know, that's going to cost more than I wanted it to cost.  \nMaybe I'll go with something else.   They can do that. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Well, I know you mentioned \nenergy choice and that's -- that's a real big part of this discussion.  So, \nyou don't feel in some instances with this bill you're taking away \nenergy choice the ability to hook up for natural gas -- \nMS. SIMON:  No.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n68MR. PALMESANO:  -- for lower income people that \nmight not have that additional funds?  Now they're going to have to \npay more out of pocket and -- and -- and that won't contradict with the \nhousing crisis that we're having here in New York?  \nMS. SIMON:  If you are building a new building --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Yep.\nMS. SIMON: -- and putting in gas, you can afford to \npay for the connection.  If you are building a new building and you \ndon't have this -- the amount of money it takes to connect to gas, you \nprobably shouldn't be building that building. \nMR. PALMESANO:  So, I want to go back to \nreliability again, if I may -- \nMS. SIMON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. PALMESANO: -- because I -- I started talking \nabout it and I think we kinda got off side-tracked.  The -- the -- the \nNYISO came out with a report in their Power Trends report again, \nsaying that there is thinness in the margins and that we need to make \nsure we're protecting the grid and that, obviously, recognizing the -- \nthe plan that's in place or the CLCPA is really to get to full \nelectrification by 2040 for generating purposes.  You talked about \nheating, you know, new homes.  You know, in Buffalo -- you know, \n60 percent of people in New York heat -- heat their homes with \nnatural gas.  Forty percent of our generation comes from natural gas.  \nThat number is even higher in Western New York, the Buffalo area.  \nSo, with the -- the NYISO saying that the reliability of the grid is in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n69jeopardy with -- with the thinness in the margins and now they're \ntalking about looking to reopen shuttered power plants, shuttered \nfossil fuel plants, shouldn't we be looking to keep what we can on line \nand make it easier for people to hook up to a reliable source of energy, \nwhich natural gas is reliable, it's affordable and it's dispatchable.  \nElectric heat, based on renewals -- renewables is not dispatchable. \nMS. SIMON:  Okay.  So, first of all, this bill only \ntalks about who pays for the gas connection.  \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yeah, I know that but --\nMS. SIMON:  That's all -- that's all this bill talks \nabout.  So, the reality is that while Western New York does have a lot \nof gas customers, it's actually very inexpensive, the gas is much more \ninexpensive in Western New York.  In New York City, for example, \nit's, you know, multiple, multiple times more expensive to do that.  So, \nbut, again, this is only about putting in who pays for the gas \nconnection.  In the NYISO report, let me remind you that NYISO is \nabout the electric grid, not the gas grid.  And so we are talking only \nabout the electric grid. \nMR. PALMESANO:  But, Ms. Simon, you realize \nthat electricity is produced by natural gas and that's part of the process \nthat we're talking about.  This is all going to affect the price of natural \ngas. \nMS. SIMON:  So, thank you for acknowledging that \nmuch electricity is produced by natural gas --  \nMR. PALMESANO:  Forty percent. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n70MS. SIMON:  That's right, 40 percent and the fact is \nthat we are -- new renewables are producing just -- are capable of \nproducing just as much electricity and they are increasing in their \nreliability and their cost efficiency over time because of technology.  \nAnd technology in five years, you won't even have a question.  In less \nthan five years you won't have a question about this. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Well, I'm -- I'm sure there'll be \nplenty of questions in five years -- \nMS. SIMON:  You might still have a question.\nMR. PALMESANO:  -- there's questions now and I \nthink that's problematic.\nLet's talk about property taxes.  Utilities pay some of \nthe highest property taxes in the State of New York.  So, and for a gas \ncustomer they get paid on the amount of gas that goes through the \npipes, which is obviously paid for plus fixed costs.  So, if you have \nless gas going through the pipes, that's going to have less property \ntaxes being paid that's going to be shifted to the property taxpayer, \ncorrect?\nMS. SIMON:  Well, I -- I have to tell you, the \nproperty tax element of the amount of gas going through a pipe is not \nsomething I'm familiar with.  I doubt very much anybody is paying \nproperty taxes on the amount of gas in a pipe.  But gas fills the pipe, \nright?  Gas and not water.  It fills -- it -- it's going to maintain that \npressure.  But the reality is that this is not taking out a pipeline.  \nWherever there's a property tax being paid on the fossil fuel \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n71infrastructure, that property tax, which by the way, is borne by you \nand I, will in fact remain.  So, remember that the utility itself doesn't \never pay for anything.  You and I pay for everything. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  So, it is your contention, \nnumber one, that -- that since this is residential and as new \nconstruction is not going to be an additional cost of the -- the \nhomeowner.  Is that your argument?  \nMS. SIMON:  My argument is, if someone wants to \nput in a gas line that's brand new, they should pay for it, not you and I.  \nThat's the argument. \nMR. PALMESANO:  So, all right.  And I keep \nbouncing back and forth and I apologize.  I want to get back to the job \nportion of this, too.  I talked about the pipeline contractors.  You said \nthere's no consideration or concern for these workers, because you do \n-- I know you recognize that some of these special union \napprenticeships for gas workers are five years long, they have to get \nrecertified on a yearly basis.  Is it your belief that, you know, we make \nthis switch to electric that there -- there -- they can make that switch to \nthe electric field just like that?  Is that your belief?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, A, no, that is not my belief and \nthat was not an -- a -- a -- an accurate recitation of my prior response \nbut this bill has nothing to do with the electric grid.  This bill has to do \nwith who pays for setting up a new gas connection in a residential \nproperty.  That is all.\nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  A couple more \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n72questions here if you'd just bear with me. \nSo, you talked property taxes, you talked a little bit \nabout reliability and it's still your contention that this would not do \nanything to jeopardize  the reliability grid, because people won't have \n-- they'll still be able to access gas.  Is that you -- is that what you're \nsaying?\nMS. SIMON:  I'm sorry, could you -- the last -- the \nlast sentence you kind of mumbled a little.  \nMR. PALMESANO:  It's still -- it's still your \ncontention that with this, the -- the concerns that have been brought up \nby the NYISO on reliability factors, the shortfalls that are in place, the \nfact that now less people might have -- well, the -- they might not \nhave access to natural gas because it might be more expensive for \nthem and that's your contention then, right?  \nMS. SIMON:  This bill does nothing to eliminate \ntheir access to gas -- \nMR. PALMESANO:  Right.\nMS. SIMON:  -- it just says, you want to put in a new \nline, you pay for it.  By the way, you and I are paying for their -- their \nproperty taxes as well. \nMR. PALMESANO:  All right.  Thank you, Ms. \nSimon.\nI'm going to go on the bill from here on, I think. \nMS. SIMON:  You're welcome. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Thanks for your time.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n73ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. PALMESANO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nYou know, my colleague says this is going to save taxpayers money \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of a couple hundred million dollars.  \nThe costs we're seeing coming down the pipeline with the enactment \nof the CLCPA to the march towards full electrification which is \nencouraging people to get off natural gas, to get onto electrification, \nthere wa just a -- a poll put out in place that said 71 percent of New \nYorkers want to keep their natural gas, two-thirds of New Yorkers \nwant a balance between renewables and natural gas, including 74 \npercent of democrats.  This is just really I think an energy policy -- \npart of an overall energy policy that affordability, reliability and \nfeasibility are not a priority, especially when people are struggling \nwith high utility bills.  Again, as we said, 60 percent of New Yorkers \nare heating their homes with natural gas.  Forty percent of our \ngeneration is coming from natural gas.  This policy -- the other policy \nlike the heat act, other policies, the CLC -- all derives from the \nCLCPA, which we passed in 2019.  It's really designed -- the plan is \npretty obvious; it's to design, to dismantle.  The affordable and reliable \nnatural gas infrastructure supply and delivery system is designed \nultimately to take away consumer choice on how you heat you home, \ncook your food, power your building and the vehicle you drive.  It will \njeopardize  the reliability of the grid, leading to dangerous blackouts \nand it will continue our nation leading out-migration.  This is really a \nmarch towards full electrification, and the electricity is going to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n74increase the demand on the electricity, which will increase electricity \nrates and I'll talk about some of those electricity rates in a little bit.  \nRight now the PSC has a gas planning proceedings going on that are \nlooking at the affordability of electricity, the pace of electrification, \ncan the electric system reliably provide power and the heating needs \nof people.  Looking at alternative fuels like renewable natural gas and \nhydrogen, looking at -- focusing on reliable service.  We should be \nwaiting to see what these results come out with before we move \nforward with plans like this.  \nI know we talked about the 100-foot rule being a \nsubsidy.  Yeah, there's a subsidy to it, but what this will do is it's going \nto increase the cost of new homes and businesses, because saying that \nit's going to increase costs by -- with where we are now isn't accurate \nbecause it will increase the cost of homes, it's going to jeopardize  \ngood, reliable paying jobs for union workers and will increase rates \nfor the rest of us because, you have to remember, when new people \nget on the gas service that are helping to contribute to pay for the \nexisting fixed costs of the operational, of the infrastructure, of the \ncapital costs, they're helping to pay for that.  So, it's not a one-to-one \nsavings that's going to be paid back over time, that -- figured that's \namortized over 60 years.  The -- the rate paid, that money's being paid \nback through the rates, and all of us are benefiting from it because it's \na reliable, affordable source of energy.  And when we can have that \nfixed cost covered with more ratepayers, it'll cover the operation, it'll \ncover the capitol fixed cost, that's a benefit to everyone.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n75You know, as I've talked about before, you know, I'll \nsay it again, it's really -- my concern is where we're heading down this \ntrack is to really get away from natural gas.  It's a cleaning burning \nfuel, it's a reliable, it's a dispatchable burning fuel.  And I've often \nheard of natural gas as being a bridge fuel.  Well, you don't tear down \na bridge before you build a new one, but that's exactly what's \nhappening with the policy here that we're putting in place in the State \nof New York.\nWhen we talk about cost, and I know my -- my -- my \ncolleague talked how this is going to save costs for ratepayers.  I'd like \nto see the concern for the ratepayer, but everything is being advanced \nin this House and is being advocated since the CLCPA in 2019 is not \nhelping the ratepayers.  As we talked about the emissions that are \nbeing measured under the CLCPA, which is driving up rates, said if \nwe don't make the change to the emissions, standards that are being \nused by every other state in the country, by international and U.S. \nCode, it will increase prices at the pumps for New Yorkers by 63 cents \na gallon, will in fact increase natural gas home heating costs, which \nwe're talking about natural gas, for New Yorkers by 79 percent.  We \ntalked about electricity rates and rates, the PSC in July of 2023 passed \n$43 billion in future ratepayer increases to pay for these green energy \nmandates that are being advocated.  We talked about the electric, you \nknow, electrification - and I know this is talking about (indiscernible), \nbut the fact of the matter is to convert your home, the push is trying to \nget people off natural gas.  When that time comes, it will cost them \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n76over $35,000 to convert their home over from natural to affordable, \nreliable, dispatchable natural gas to electric that isn't reliable.  And we \ndidn't talk about the EV school bus, we didn't talk about ACT \nregulation, we didn't talk about the Advanced Clean Car rule which \nwill have significant impacts to the grid.  The grid has jeopardy.  \nIn -- in 2019, before we passed the CLCPA, the elect \n-- the residential electricity rate in the State of New York was 70 cents \n-- 17 cents per kilowatt hour.  Now, it's over 26 cents per kilowatt \nhour, that's more than 40 percent higher than the national average.  So, \nthe policies that are being pushed in this House are driving up \nelectricity rates for New Yorkers.  You see the electric bills that you're \ngetting in the mail, you're hearing from your constituents.  It's -- it's -- \nit's problematic, but what you fail to recognize really it's the policies \nthat you're continuing to being advanced in this House, which \ncontinue to drive up those rates because they're mandated to do these \nthings to pay for these green mandates that are being in place.  And \ncommercial rates are very, very similar.  Rely -- reliability.  So, that's \nsome of the (indiscernible), the reliability.  When you talk about \nbusinesses in New York State, they care about two things when it \ncomes to energy:  Affordable and reliable.  If they can't get reliable \nenergy in New York or affordable energy in New York, they're going \nto go elsewhere.  The NYISO has sent out a warning signal that we \nshould all be heeding and paying attention to.  They're literally talking \nabout powering plants that have been shut down to meet the reliability \ngrids concerns that are out there.  But yet, we see time and time again \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n77about the natural gas and pipelines.  Here we are with the -- the other \nthing the -- the NYISO said, by 2040, you need 27 to 45 gigawatts of \ndispatchable emission-free resources.  Gigawatt -- one gigawatt is \nequivalent of powering 750,000 homes.  We need 27 to 45 gigawatts \nof that.  Our total generating capacity in the State of New York is 41 \ngigawatts, that's with wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, natural gas.  So, we \nneed 27 to 45 gigawatts of dispatchable emission-free resources.  The \nState has no idea what that resource is going to be.  Is it going to be \nadvanced nuclear, is it going to be hydrogen, is it going to be \nrenewable natural gas, carbon capture and sequestration?  We don't \nknow, no one knows but we continue down this path at full speed \nahead, this march to full electrification, making it harder and more \nexpensive for people to hook up onto electrification and try --  to \nnatural gas, and try get them off natural gas.  As I said before, natural \ngas has always been referred to as a bridge fuel, but again you don't \ntear down a bridge before you build a new one, but that's exactly what \nwe're doing with our energy policy in the State.  Feasibility, not only \ndo you need 27- 45 gigawatts of dispatchable emission-free resources, \nwe need over 120 gigawatts of new generation.  That's wind, solar, \nhydro.  I mean that's just not possible.  That's not sustainable, that's \nnot feasible.  \nIt's no doubt this House, the Governor really has \nshown an animosity towards you using natural gas.  First the ban on \npac -- fracking, second, pipeline denials for getting natural gas, \nwhether it's in the Northeast  or throughout New York State or down to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n78the City areas, having a pipeline project be displayed.  Denying air \npermits for new natural gas power plants and also denying air permits \nfor renewals.  And then we see now with this and we've seen other \nproposals that really want to just have more people off natural gas.  I \nwill repeat again, 71 percent of New Yorkers want natural gas.  \nSeventy-six percent of independents say that, they don't want a gas \nban, but this is -- this is the route we're heading down with these \npolicies.  Two-thirds of New Yorkers want a balance of renewable \nand natural gas.  They want all of the above, including 74 percent of \ndemocrats.  And just like your 401K, you don't put it all in stocks, \ncash and bonds, you diversify it to protect it, to make it more resilient.  \nThat's what we should be doing with our energy policy in the State of \nNew York.  So we can talk about those things.  We talk about cost, \naffordability, reliability, feasibility, the property tax burden.  I talked \nabout that a little bit.  Utilities pay some of the highest property taxes \nin the country.  Our power producers pay like over $1.8 billion in \n(indiscernible), but the utilities pay on the amount of gas that goes \nthrough their pipeline.  If the gas -- amount of gas that's going through \nthe pipelines has decreased, that's going to be less that they're going to \nbe paying in property taxes, but that's going to be put on the local \nproperty taxpayer more in addition to higher rates because you have -- \nthose two you still have those same fixed costs with less users.  Talk \nabout land use.  Our land use for wind and solar has taken up lands in \nUpstate New York, taken up farmlands.  We've talked about the -- the \nbatteries for powering EVs, you know, the human rights and the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n79environmental pollutions from that.  Talk about energy security with \nwind, solar.  With solar, 80 -- 80 plus percent of solar is -- comes from \nChina.  Eighty percent of the rare earth materials come from China, \nand I know this is done under the guise of climate change and global \nemissions, but I will remind my colleagues in this House, .4 percent, \njust .4 percent of global emissions come from New York.  Thirty \npercent come from China and China has 1,000 coal plants and \nbuilding more every week, over 1,000 a week -- they have 1,000 coal \nplants and building more every week.  In fact, last year, China \nexpanded their coal generating capacity in the State of New York by \n95 gigawatts.  Think about that.  They expanded their coal generating \ncapacity by double what our total generating capacity in New York.  \nHow does this make any sense to anyone?  It's just more cost, more \nburden on our ratepayers, on our businesses.  \nAnd I'll -- I'll just -- I'll close, I think this is a \nstatement from the -- the laborers pack expressing their opposition to \nthis legislation:  This legislation, while -- while well-intentioned, \nwould lead to increased costs for ratepayers, the loss of career track \nconstruction jobs and an unreliable electrical grid.  The transmission \nto an emission-free future must account for current realities, which \nincludes the impact on grid reliability and the potential for adverse \nfiscal and economic implications.  I think those three -- several lines \nsums it up pretty good.  This is a problem moving forward.  I -- I -- I \njust think it's the wrong policy.  I continue to see the policy, I continue \nto see the concerns coming out from the other side about high \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n80electrical -- high utility bills, but it's quick to go after the utilities \nwhen -- for -- when they go for rate increases, but when the PSC \napproved $43 billion in future rate pay increases to pay for the green \nenergy mandates that this House is advocating for, I didn't hear \nanyone speak up.  Our side of the aisle will continue to speak up for \nthe ratepayer, our side of the aisle will continue to point out the flaws \nwith the energy policy in the State, whether it's the affordability crisis, \nwhether it's the reliability crisis, whether it's the feasibility of this \npolicy not being feasible.  We will continue to talk about it, we will \ncontinue to act and hopefully at some point in time, this House will \nunderstand that and make the right decisions to address these policies \nthat aren't going to work for the public we represent.  It's not going to \nwork for the senior citizens, it's not going to work for the veteran -- \ndisabled veteran, it's not going to work for our small businesses and \nmanufactures, it's not going to work for anyone.  So, for these reasons, \nMadam Speaker, and for a whole --a whole host of other reasons, I'm \ngoing to be voting in the negative and I would urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Ari Brown. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n81ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  I'd \nlike to focus on the amendment of Section 31 of the Public Service \nLaw.  I found that it's very limited in the amendment and there's a lot \nof conflicts.  I have a feeling we'll probably be back for a chapter \namendment at some point, but let's get into that a little bit if you don't \nmind. \nMS. SIMON:  Chapter amendment?\nMR. A. BROWN:  As Public Service Law we know \nit's designed to ensure fair, universal access to gas and electric utility \nservice in New York.  So, this -- this particular bill doesn't eliminate \ngas service, it just changes the dynamics of how it's provided.  And \nthat being said, how can we claim to uphold this Public Service Law \nmandate for fair and equitable access to utility service when this bill \nmakes gas access financially unreachable for tens of thousands of \nworking class families?  In other words, if you're rich, okay, I'll pay \nfor the service, but those who can't afford it, it becomes a luxury item?  \nMS. SIMON:  I would disagree with the premise of \nyour question in -- in its entirety.  The reality is this has nothing to do \nwith the affordability, except that because you would be paying -- if \nyou build a new building, a new residential hookup and you're \nbuilding that building and there's a new residential gas hookup, you \npay for it.  If you were building that within a hundred feet, you \nwouldn't -- all your neighbors would pay.  And what this bill says is, if \nyou can afford to build a building, you're obviously building \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n82something, pay for it yourself.  That's fair and equitable.  Has nothing \nto do with access, has nothing to do with the reliability of the system.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  \nMaybe I wasn't clear.  As we know throughout the State -- State of \nNew York, you can buy a house for 100,000, you can buy a home for \n$100 million.  The person who's building the $100 million home, well, \nan extra 10- or $15,000 to run this service may not be a big deal, but \nthe person, the hardworking blue-collared person that scrimped and \nsaved and was able -- he has a piece of land, perhaps it was inherited, \nsaid, you know, I'd like gas service.  Ten thousand dollars, ten percent \nof the cost of the home that it's going to cost me to build is just too \nmuch.  So we're saying the rich guy can have it and now the poor guy \ncan't?  \nMS. SIMON:  If the poor guy is building a new home \nwithin 100 feet of the gas line, he can afford to build a new home \nwithin 100 feet of the gas line.  The closer it is to the gas line, the cost \nof the connection is cheaper.  The cost of the service, the cost of your \ngas on an ongoing basis for -- to -- that is, you know, heating your \nhome, it doesn't change at all.  The only thing that would change is \nthat the rest of us would not be paying for your hookup, which would \nsave us all a couple of bucks.  And you know, Section 31 of the Public \nService Law didn't include the 100-foot law until 1981.  So, you \nknow, people had gas before that, too. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  \nMS. SIMON:  And they paid for it themselves.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n83MR. A. BROWN:  Since I was building before that, I \ncan tell you it was -- gas was a lot cheaper back then.  The service was \nnot. \nMS. SIMON:  It's not about the cost of gas.  Gas itself \nis not going up.  Gas itself has been stable.  What has gone up is the \ndelivery charges.  And in the delivery charges is the 100-foot rule that \nyou and I are paying for and we're saying the other ratepayers should \nbenefit by -- if you're going to buy -- build a house, you're going to, \nlet's say, convert from oil.  You're doing that, it's a big job.  \nCalculating the cost of that connection, which is not that much money, \nto just do the connection, right?  It's just the connection, it's not the \nongoing service.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  You \n-- you made a point, so I'd like to ask you about that.  What do you \nconsider not expensive?  A hundred foot or less to your typical home, \nmiddle of New York. \nMS. SIMON:  Well, in the middle of New York, \nthere is many -- there are many places that actually don't have gas at \nall.  So, that would be very expensive.  So, it really depends on how \nfar away you are from the main, what kind of terrain you're going \nthrough and you know, some of the estimates are as low as $500 to \nconnect to a new system.  Others are higher, it depends on the -- the \nsize of the building, what size connector you need.  So, these are all \ncosts that are already known to people who do this work and the \nreality is, you and I, we believe, should not be paying for the guy next \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n84door to put in a brand new connection.  He should be paying for it \nhimself if he can afford -- if he's doing that work, he can afford to pay \nfor it. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  \nCould you cite where you got that as low as $500 fee?  And are you \nfamiliar -- \nMS. SIMON:  I looked it up online, Dr. Google.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.\nMS. SIMON:  Thank you.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Would -- would -- do you \nunderstand how the process of connection is made?  After all, this bill \nis -- if someone wanted to get a connection, what is the process of \nhow that goes about for $500 or $1,000?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, the $500 is an estimate on the \nlow end of a new connection.  That is all it is.  It has nothing to do \nwith the process of getting connected.  You reach out to your utility \nand ask what the process is.  If you go to National Grid's website the \nfirst thing they say is, hold on, maybe you don't want gas because \nrenewable fuels are doing much better.   So, I'm just suggesting that \nthat is also a reality, but that's not what this bill addresses. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Are you familiar with, though, \nlike I asked, how that's done?  What happens, how do they connect to \nthe gas service?  What's the physical process?  After all this bill is \nbased on that. \nMS. SIMON:  The bill is not based on that.  The bill \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n85is based on who pays, you, putting in a new system, or me and all of \nus paying for your cost.  I think it's fair and equitable if you pay your \nown cost. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.\nMS. SIMON:  Thank you.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Is it not true, in fact, that when \nthey have to break the spur, put in a T and run this service, we're \ntalking a minimum of $7,500 even on Long Island where there's a \nsand strata and no clay and it couldn't be any easier?\nMS. SIMON:  That may be, I'm not going to dispute \nyou figure, but the reality is your figure is irrelevant.  What is relevant \nis whether you pay it or we pay it.\nMR. A. BROWN:  So, let's get into that.  Thank you, \nMadam Sponsor.  \nSo, the -- this section of section -- this section of \nSection 31 of the Public Service Law didn't change.  It still reads, if \nSection 31 guarantees reasonable utility access and this bill now \nblocks gas service to -- because of unaffordable fees, isn't this bill \ninviting litigation on constitutional grounds of utility discrimination or \nselective access?  \nMS. SIMON:  Not in any way, shape or form.  That's \nthe answer. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Okay.  So how can the State not \ncontinue to promise utility access under Public Service Law 31 while \nknowingly implementing policies, like this bill, that make service \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n86functionally inaccessible to all but the wealthy?  \nMS. SIMON:  It doesn't make it functionally \ninaccessible.  \nMR. A. BROWN:  Okay.  If -- if a group can't afford \nit because now it got too expensive because -- in other words, if I \nbuild a home and I build many, beforehand, under a foot or less, the \ngas utility company would bring the service to my -- to -- to my \nproject.  If -- if it was 101 feet like you had mentioned before, I would \nown that -- that property.  But if I'm a person who scrimped and saved \nand somehow couldn't rebuild this house, it would be cheaper to \nrebuild this house, I'm saying to them, you know, sorry.  You're not in \nan affluent area.  I want you to spend at least ten or 15 percent of the \ncost of construction of your entire home , you're not wealthy.   We're \npunishing people who don't have the means, and that's exactly what \nthis bill does. \nMS. SIMON:  Not -- it does not at all.  What it says is \nwe will no longer pay -- punish the ratepayers for the cost of you \nputting in something within 100 feet.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Okay.  Thank you, Madam \nSponsor.  Was there an economic impact assessment showing that this \nwon't result in reduced housing costs throughout the State?  Because \nas we know, our economy is based on housing starts and the housing \nstarts in New York are way down.  Forget about New York City, that \nshow is over.  But at least for the rest of the State, have we done an \neconomic impact study?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n87MS. SIMON:  The housing costs in New York State \nare not driven by whether someone has a new connector to gas.  They \nare driven by many, many factors as I'm sure you would understand, \nas a person in that business.  So, the reality is, you can't hang that \nwhole thing on the 100-foot rule, because right now the costs are \ngoing up and the 100-foot rule exists.  So, just false premise.  \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you for that.  So, let me \nelaborate on that thought.  Yes, this is just one component.  We're \nonly adding whether two percent or five percent of the cost or \nsometimes ten percent.  But when you put that in -- in combination \nwith now walls have to be built at an R-20 and the roof has to be a \nfactor of an R-50 and our cost construction now goes up 50 percent \nthan it was three or four years ago, it's another factor why people \naren't building.  In other words, when I buy a piece of property, isn't it \ntrue that now my costs are so much more than they were several years \nago because of bills like this?\nMS. SIMON:  No. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Can you explain that -- that \nstatement, please?\nMS. SIMON:  You just explained it yourself.  Your \ncosts are going up and this bill isn't in existence.  Your costs are going \nup for a varity of reasons and there's no way that you can convince me \nthat paying the cost of a new connection, just a new connection to gas, \nis going to increase the cost of building a house by 50 percent.  That is \nsimply not true. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n88MR. A. BROWN:  Okay.  So -- \nMS. SIMON:  In nobody's world. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.\nMS. SIMON:  Thank you.\nMR. A. BROWN:  So, again, if my costs were a \nhalf-a-million dollars to build a house, or $100,000 to build a house \nand now I'm going to have another $15,000 that I didn't before, \nwouldn't that cost me more money?\nMS. SIMON:  Well, the quick -- the quick answer is, \nnumber one, you're just making up that $15,000 for a $100,000 home.  \nNobody's building a $100,000 home these days, anyway, number one.  \nAnd number two, you don't have -- have to choose gas.  You can \nchoose electricity, which in fact is easier and cheaper to install and \nmuch more cost-efficient and effective. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  As \na matter of fact, isn't it true that I can buy a very nice modular home \nfor 1,200 -- 1,200 square feet, which I recently did, a place Upstate for \nunder $100,000 and if gas was accessible and it was under 100 feet, it \nwould cost me between 7,500 and $12,000?  Isn't that a real number \nfrom a guy whose been in the business for 50 years?  \nMS. SIMON:  It -- it might be a real number in that \nparticular instance, but the reality, the question here, the only question \nbefore us here, is should you pay for that connection or should your \nneighbors?  So, you're just basically -- your constituents are paying for \neverybody else already.  That's a fact and that's -- that is in fact the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n89current law.  So, this is actually going to help your constituents. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  \nLet's get into existing homes.  So, Section 3 of the Public Service \nLaw, subject to the requirement of subdivisions 4 and 5 in this section, \nwhenever a residential customer moves to a new residence within the \nservice territory of the same utility corporation or municipality, he \nshall be eligible to receive service at the new residence and such \nservice shall be considered a continuation of service in all respects, \nwith any deferred payment agreement honored, and with all rights of \nsuch customer and such utility corporation provided by this article \nunimpaired.  In other words, I move down the block, guess what, \nyou're putting in that service for under 100 feet and it's not going to \ncost me anything.  That section wasn't changed in this bill amendment. \nMS. SIMON:  No, because it's not relevant to this \nbill.  The reality is, if you are moving to a new building and there's \nalready a gas connector, you get gas.  You don't have to pay any of \nthat. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor. \nMS. SIMON:  Thank you.\nMR. A. BROWN:  That's not what this -- that's not \nwhat the -- the Public Service Law says.  It actually says that you will \nprovide me the same service I had before, unless there's a further \namendment, means you're running that line and it's not costing me \nanything.  That's exactly what it means. \nMS. SIMON:  It's just the service that we're -- that -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n90that -- that that section refers to.  So, the reality is, it's just a service.  \nThis doesn't affect the service, it affects the connector -- new \nconnector to the gas line.  That is it, sir.\nMR. A. BROWN:  I -- I respectfully disagree and I \nguess we'll see that in the chapter amendment.  So --  \nMS. SIMON:  I don't think so.\nMR. A. BROWN:  On another section.  Isn't there a \nconflict, it says a utility corporation or municipality shall institute \nservice to any applicant who meets the requirement of subdivision one \nof this section, within five business days after such applicant applies \nfor service.  It goes on, the utility corporation, municipality shall \ninstitute service to any applicant who meets the requirement of subs -- \nof -- of subdivision 1 of this section within five business days after \nsuch applicant applies for service.  It goes on, the utility corporation or \nmunicipality shall initiate service promptly to applicants and -- and -- \nand any such corporation, municipality which fails to provide timely \nservice to an applicant as required by the subdivision with good cause \nand determine it's even penalty per day.  This section has -- has \nsomething to do with continued utility service, but it also has to do \nwith if you had service, they're going to run that new line for you as \nwell, unencumbered without expense.  It's -- I'm looking at the \nsection, you have your assistants right there.  They'll tell you the same \nthing.  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, if it's a new line and it's 101 feet \naway from the gas line, you're paying for it anyway and all we're \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n91saying is if you're 99 feet, now you pay.  That's all.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor.  \nWith respect, the -- the section doesn't say that, but I guess we'll see \nthat in the chapter amendment.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill, please. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. A. BROWN:  I'm big believer in redundancy.  \nWhen I installed my own boiler piece by piece, I made sure they were \nredundant systems.  Instead of just having one zone valve to handle \nfive zones, I ran circulators for each and every zone in case something \nwent down.  As we all remember, during Hurricane Sandy, who were \nthe only people that had hot water?  It was those of us that had a gas \nhot water heater which requires no electricity.  As a matter of fact, if \nyou had a steam boiler, which works off of millivolts, you didn't need \nelectricity, also.  I'm a major fan of electric heat pumps, but the \nproblem is under zero degrees they're not not only efficient, many \ntimes they'll actually freeze up and not work.  We saw this happen in \nTexas where they thought they could rely on solar and -- and power \nlike that and they had a disaster a few years back.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nBrown.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Sponsor [sic].\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Durso.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for some questions?\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n92ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMS. SIMON:  Certainly.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Ms. Simon.  So, just to \ncontinue with this debate, is this for new construction only, or is this \nfor current residential homes?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, it is for new construction if it's \nstarted before December 31st, after which it would need to be electric \nanyway.  And it is for existing homes if you are converting let's say, \nfrom propane or oil, right?  So, it's a new gas connector.  If it's not a \nnew gas connection, irrelevant.  Entirely -- \nMR. DURSO:  Right, because you already have gas \nat that point.  So, why would you need it?  \nMS. SIMON:  That's exactly right.  Most buildings \nthat have gas, already have gas.  \nMR. DURSO:  But this is not for commercial use, \ncorrect?  \nMS. SIMON:  No, it is not.  \nMR. DURSO:  And mixed-use?  I know it was asked \nbefore, but I apologize, I didn't hear the answer.  \nMS. SIMON:  Mixed-use, you're gonna have to duke \nthat out with the -- the Public Service Comission, the utility and the \nlocality.  I think it depends on what kind of connections you're putting \nin.  So, if you're putting in a connection to the business uses, right, or \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n93that section of the building that's commercial, that is currently -- \nwould be a cost borne by whoever is doing that.  If it's within 100 feet, \nthe PSC has already determined that it's going to be borne by the other \ncustomers.  But the reality, of course, is that commercial rates are far \ncheaper than residential rates as you know.  If it's for the residential \nportion and it's a new connection, then the builder would pay for it, \npresupposing it's within 100 feet.  If it's farther than 100 feet from the \ngas line, the -- whoever's building that building would pay for it. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So, with -- with that being \nsaid, the apartment buildings themselves, are they all considered \nresidential or commercial?  \nMS. SIMON:  I think I just answered the question.  If \nthere's a -- you're talking about building a new building -- \nMR. DURSO:  No, no, no.  I'm sorry.  For -- for -- for \nan existing building -- \nMS. SIMON:  Okay.\nMR. DURSO:  -- that is currently, right now, as an \napartment building of let's say five or more units, right, and they want \nto hook up to gas.  Are those -- because now some buildings that have \nthat are considered commercial, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  It's -- this is about residents -- new \nresidential hookups only.  \nMR. DURSO:  No, I under -- so, this is strictly for \nresidential.  So, if you're a commercial building, but you have ten \napartment units in it, this doesn't concern you.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n94MS. SIMON:  If you're a -- no.  That's a mixed-use \nbuilding.  \nMR. DURSO:  Correct.  So, who's paying that -- \nwho's paying --\nMS. SIMON:  So, I just answered that question.\nMR. DURSO:  Well, but I'm saying, but who's -- \nwho's paying for that hookup?  \nMS. SIMON:  The residential portion of that \nbuilding, if you have a mixed-use building, it's the same answer.  The \n-- the commercial part would be paid for by the --\nMR. DURSO:  The utility.\nMS. SIMON:  -- it's connected to wherever it's \nconnected pursuant to the PSC regulations, right?  Their rule.  If it's -- \nif it's residential, right now and only if it's within 100 feet of the gas \nline, right, then the ratepayers in your neighborhood would pay for it \nand the builder who puts in that new building and is going to be \ncollecting rents from that 500 units, is going to actually be making a \nbundle, because everybody else is paying for that connection. \nMR. DURSO:  Well, that was my question.  So, if \nyou have a residential standalone home, right --\nMS. SIMON:  Yes.\nMR. DURSO: -- and you -- and you have gas within \n100 feet, you have to now pay for it on your own, correct?  Which is -- \nMS. SIMON:  If you are putting in a new connection \nonly.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n95MR. DURSO:  Yes.  Yes, if you're putting in a new \nconnection.  But if I have a commercial building that has tenants in it, \napartment building, who -- \nMS. SIMON:  It's mixed-use.\nMR. DURSO:  Yes, a mixed-use --\nMS. SIMON:  Right.\nMR. DURSO: -- is the building now responsible for \npaying for that 100 foot connection?  \nMS. SIMON:  Are you saying that the owner of the \nbuilding, the landlord is a running a commercial operation with \nresidential customers?\nMR. DURSO:  Yes.\nMS. SIMON:  And that has somehow different than a \nmixed-use building?  I don't believe that's the case, right?  This is \nabout new residential connections.  If it is a -- an apartment building \nbeing put in and somebody who's a developer, or a builder, is putting \nin that building, they would bear that cost for the residential \nconnection if it's within 100 feet. \nMR. DURSO:  Ma'am, but you keep saying new \nbuildings.  I'm saying existing buildings.  \nMS. SIMON:  If it's an existing building, and it's \nalready connected to gas --  \nMR. DURSO:  No, it's not connected to gas.  If you \nhave -- \nMS. SIMON:  Okay.  So, what's it connected to in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n96your example?\nMR. DURSO:  Oil.\nMS. SIMON:  Oil.  You're going to put in a big \napartment building, you have a 500 unit -- \nMR. DURSO:  No, no, no.  I'm not saying put it in a \nbuilding -- apartment building.  I'm saying one already exists.  It has \ncurrently being heated by oil.  They have gas lines within 100 feet.  \nAre they allowed to get that hookup to that commercial building that \nhas 30 units in it?  \nMS. SIMON:  They're allowed to get to the \nconnection, nobody's stopping them from connecting. \nMR. DURSO:  Correct.  Now, will -- will the utility \npay for that?  \nMS. SIMON:  The utility doesn't pay for anything.  \nYou pay for it.  \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  But, you --\nMS. SIMON:  The reality is, whether you're paying \nfor the connection, or your neighbors are paying for the connection -- \nMR. DURSO:  Well, how would that work for that \nbuilding then? \nMS. SIMON:  The utility isn't paying for anything.\nMR. DURSO:  How would -- so, are we all paying \nfor that commercial building that has 30 units in it?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes.\nMR. DURSO:  So, why are they allowed to do it, but \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n97a residential customer cannot? \nMS. SIMON:  Well, we are changing the law.  The \nlaw --\nMR. DURSO:  Right, so why wouldn't we add that \nin?\nMS. SIMON:  Well, the law applies to residential \nhookups.  The PSC regulation applies to commercial.  The law is \nsilent on the commercial.   \nMR. DURSO:  Okay. \nMS. SIMON:  That is why.\nMR. DURSO:  So -- so, again, the mixed-use \nbuildings and their commercial building that has 30 or so units in it, if \nthey want to hook up to gas, we're all going to pay for it.  That's okay, \nbut a residential person -- a person that has a residential home, has to \npay for it on their own.\nMS. SIMON:  Well, you know, I didn't say it was \nokay.  I just said that's what currently is the PSC regulation. \nMR. DURSO:  Well, why didn't we put that in the \nbill?\nMS. SIMON:  I would suggest you reach out to the \nPSC and ask them to undo that regulation.\nMR. DURSO:  I -- well, I -- I wouldn't have did this \nbill, so I'm just wondering why -- \nMS. SIMON:  This bill?  This bill is an amendment \nto the law, not the PSC's regulation, which we have no control over \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n98their regulations. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So -- so, let's go with this law \nthen since it seems that the commercial use are -- are getting a break. \nMS. SIMON:  They haven't.  They always do \nanyway, they pay cheaper rates. \nMR. DURSO:  Well, good thing we're not changing it \nnow then.  So, with that being said, ma'am, the -- the hookup that goes \nfrom the -- the street if it's within 100 feet to the house, you were \nsaying now it's going to be on the residents, right?  The -- the person \nthat wants to get that hookup, they have to pay for it solely on their \nown, correct?\nMS. SIMON:  The residential customer who wants a \nnew connection, yes. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  If you are going from gas to \nelectric, right, let's just say you're gonna -- you're gonna power your \nwhole home by electric at that point.  Who's paying for that?  Let's say \nthey wanted to do the opposite.  \nMS. SIMON:  Currently, until we pass the -- the rest \n-- the New York Heat Act, currently, what will happen is that you are \npaying to convert, right?  And if you're paying to convert, you're \npaying to convert. \nMR. DURSO:  So, you have to -- so, if I'm the -- if \nI'm the residential customer and I want to get rid of gas and I want to \nconvert to all electric, I pay for that on my own, right?  The utility \ndoesn't?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n99MS. SIMON:  Yes.  And if you're smart, you talk to \nNYSERDA  and get a tax credit. \nMR. DURSO:  Oh, perfect.  Okay.  So, on top of that, \nif I'm hooking up to gas, let's say I'm the residential customer and I \nfind out that gas is in the street, right, within 100 feet and I can then \npay for that on my own, correct?  Am I allowed to hire a private \ncontractor to do that?  \nMS. SIMON:  This has nothing to do with who you \nhire to do -- \nMR. DURSO:  I'm just asking if there's language in \nthe bill if you can hire a private contractor. \nMS. SIMON:  There's no language in the bill that \nsays yay or nay on hiring a private contractor -- \nMR. DURSO:  So, who makes that decision?\nMS. SIMON:  Most people actually do hire \ncontractors to build buildings or (indiscernible/cross-talk).\nMR. DURSO:  So, again, so what you're saying is \nthat there's no language in this bill, currently, which now stops the \nutility company from taking that burden on and hooking it up, right, to \nnow, if I'm the residential customer and I say, I want gas.  I can go \nout, get a permit right through the town, or village, or city, or \nwherever you live and I could really have anybody I want do that \nwork, correct?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. SIMON:  So, that is, in fact, irrelevant to this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n100law -- this bill. \nMR. DURSO:  But it's not, though.  Because --  \nMS. SIMON:  It is irrelevant to this bill.  The bill \nsays, who pays if you're with -- if the -- the person putting in that \nbrand new connection, residential use, brand new connection is within \n100 feet, that person putting in the connection pays.  If it's more than \n100 feet -- 100 feet, that person that pays already, anyways.  So, all \nwe're doing is changing within 100 feet -- \nMR. DURSO:  Understood.\nMS. SIMON:  So all of this other stuff is -- is in the \ncategory of nice to know, but irrelevant to this bill. \nMR. DURSO:  Well, I would happen to disagree \nbecause currently, the way it's currently constituted, if want to get a \ngas up hookup, the utility has to do it, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  The utility does that.  I don't know \nwhy you would want to encourage people to do their own hookups to \nthe utility system.  I think that would be improper, but it has nothing \nto do with this law. \nMR. DURSO:  Well, it does have to do with this law \nbecause -- \nMS. SIMON:  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't.\nMR. DURSO:  Well, ma'am, unfortunately it does \nbecause currently, the utility is the one that is doing the work and \nthose workers that work for those utility companies and especially in \nmy area, are unionized labor.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n101MS. SIMON:  Okay.\nMR. DURSO:  You are literally taking away their \njobs by putting this bill in, by not addressing the fact that it is taking \nunion jobs away and if you're okay with that, that's fine.  But, what \nyou are -- you're -- what you're failing to understand is, you want to \nsay that it has nothing to do with this bill, it 100 percent does. \nMS. SIMON:  No, it does not.  It does not. \nMR. DURSO:  Everybody that -- everybody that does \nthis work, a special amount, is unionized labor.  What you're now \nsaying is it doesn't matter.  You could hire your own contractor, I don't \ncare. \nMS. SIMON:  No, I said the bill is silent on that.  \nThat's what I said.  \nMR. DURSO:  Who -- whose bill is it?\nMS. SIMON:  The bill, right here (indicating) 4A, \nyou just have to read it, it says nothing about that. \nMR. DURSO:  Whose bill is it, ma'am?\nMS. SIMON:  Sir, whoever puts in that -- that \nconnection, if it's done by union labor, under the work with the utility, \nthat would remain.  This changes that not at all.  It only changes who \npays for the connection.  You or your neighbor.  \nMR. DURSO:  But, that is -- but that's not true --\nMS. SIMON:  It is.\nMR. DURSO:  Well, under the current law, right, and \nunder the current way that it works, if I want a gas connection, the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n102utility does it.  The utility, work gets done by union labor.  Now what \nyou're saying is, I can go out and hire a private contractor. \nMS. SIMON:  I'm not saying that, you said that.  \nMR. DURSO:  Well, you're not not saying it because \nit's your bill and you didn't put it in there to protect workers.\nMS. SIMON:  No, I think -- I think that is just so far \nafield as to be ridiculous.  The reality is, sir, you can -- I am not \nrewriting the entire Public Service Law.\nMR. DURSO:  No.\nMS. SIMON:  I am not rewriting everything.  \nWhatever is already in existence remains in existence.  The only thing \nthat changes is, you put in a new connection within 100 feet in a \nresidential building, you pay for it.\nMR. DURSO:  Well, ma'am --  \nMS. SIMON:  That's it, that's all it changes.  It doesn't \nchange anything else.  \nMR. DURSO:  I understand -- I understand that, but \nas my -- as one of my colleagues asked you before, are considered \nabout the impact it will have?  \nMS. SIMON:  Of course I'm concerned but it doesn't \naffect them.\nMR. DURSO:  No, I understand that, but you're \nsaying that but it seems that the New York State laborers are \nconcerned because they put in an opposition and all those -- also the \nNew York State Conference of Union Operating Engineers.  So, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n103they're concerned, but you're not and that concerns me. \nMS. SIMON:  No, that is not true.  Don't put words \ninto my mouth.\nMR. DURSO:  No, no, no.  I'm -- \nMS. SIMON:  Do not put words into my mouth.\nMR. DURSO:  I'm not putting -- \nMS. SIMON:  Do not put words into my mouth. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Colleagues, \ncolleagues.  \nMS. SIMON:  I'm reclaiming my time.  Reclaiming \nmy time.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  We will ask \nquestions, pause and wait for an answer, please. \nMR. DURSO:  Ms. Simon, I apologize and I wasn't \ntrying to put words in your mouth.  So, I do apologize.  But, what I \nwill say, is the words are not in the bill protecting union labor and \nthat's my biggest concern. \nMS. SIMON:  This bill has nothing to do with who \ndoes the jobs --\nMR. DURSO:  I know that.\nMS. SIMON:  -- and those jobs exist to maintain the \ncurrent system.  They are not going to lose jobs because somebody \nelse pays for it instead of the ratepayers.  That is simply reality.  I \nunderstand they seem to be concerned, but I believe it is because they \nmisunderstand the bill.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n104MR. DURSO:  So, the -- the local labor unions, the \nlaborers and the operating engineers don't understand the bill?  \nMS. SIMON:  That's correct. \nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Ms. Simon.  I appreciate \nyour time and answering my questions and I apologize for the -- me \nbeing inconsiderate and putting words in your mouth.  I do apologize \nthat that's the way it came off. \nMS. SIMON:  Thank you, I appreciate that.  \nMR. DURSO:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. DURSO:  So, my biggest concern with this and I \n-- and I appreciate the sponsor taking the time to answer the questions, \nmy concern is you're right, I -- and -- and as she said, maybe I put \nwords in her mouth, the fact of the matter is, the words aren't on the \npaper and as of right now, this work goes through as union labor and \nwhat this does is negate that and puts workers, their families and the \njobs that they do, whether it's on Long Island or throughout New York \nState, in jeopardy.  I will not be supporting this bill.\nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Bologna. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield for a couple of questions?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n105MS. SIMON:  I will. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you.  I have the -- the \npremise of a lot of what I'm asking is going to be -- has been covered, \nbut I'm going in a different direction.  So, I apologize if the -- some of \nthe initial questions are a little redundant.  \nSo, would you agree with the Governor's assessment \nthat we are both in a housing and affordability crisis?  Would you \nagree with that assessment by the Governor?  \nMS. SIMON:  A, I agree with it, but it's irrelevant to \nthis bill.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  Well, we'll -- we'll get to that. \nMS. SIMON:  We're debating this bill, not the \nGovernor's messaging. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay, well, we'll get there.  So, \nlet's talk about some -- some of the -- the ways and some of the type of \nresidential housing that this impacts.  We've talked about new builds \nthat are outside of 100 feet.  In many rural areas and -- and especially \nwhere I represent, West New York, are -- there are actually local \nzoning restrictions that are beyond that.  So you have to build with at \nleast 150 feet of frontage, 200 feet of frontage and so, in those \nsituations, I'm assuming that there's no exception, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  This -- this bill addresses only the \nlength of the -- how far away from the property the gas main is.  It has \nnothing to do with frontage, et cetera, et cetera.  So, for example, if \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n106you have extensive -- if you have big -- you have a two acre zoning \nright and you're putting in something -- a gas line, new gas line and it \nis outside of 100 feet, you're paying for it now.  It doesn't change that \nat all. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  And --and again, why -- just real \nquick, why are we doing that again in this bill?\nMS. SIMON:  Why are we doing what? \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Why -- why are we -- why are we \nchanging -- changing the language of the current law?  \nMS. SIMON:  We're changing the language of the \ncurrent law because it is unfair for you and I to be paying for the \nhookups of people who are -- newly connecting to -- to the gas \nsystem.  It was some once upon a time, for other public policy reasons \nwhich no longer are those reasons.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  Got it.  And -- and again -- and \nthroughout the debate you've said, you know, it's -- it needs to be fair \nand equitable, that your neighbor should pay it for yourself.  The guy \nnext door is doing a job, why should we pay for it?  So, when it -- I \nappreciate your -- your position on self-reliance -- \nMS. SIMON:  I'm saving you money. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  I think that's great.  So, now does \nthe same apply to things like healthcare, college tuition, solar \nsubsidies, EV subsides, wind subsides, farm subsides, the migrant \ncrisis?  Can we go to -- can we go to self-reliance on all those things \nnow, too?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n107MS. SIMON:  You know, I am passing this bill, \nwhich is a short -- it's really only six lines, seven lines in the text, has \nnothing to do with any of those things.  Do I think we should be more \nequitable in many ways in our society?  Absolutely.  But, that has [sic]  \ncompletely and utterly irrelevant to this law. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So, let's go back to -- to \nregionality here in terms of, like, you know, when we talk about a lot \nof these bills, I'll kind of get a mental picture in my head and I'll start \ndriving down streets in my district and -- and looking around.  And \nespecially in a rural Niagara County, which I represent, there is [sic] \nhouses with propane tanks all over the place.\nMS. SIMON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  And -- and again, Brooklyn, right, \nif I'm not mistaken?  Do you -- do you guys have a lot of, like, house \n-- standalone houses with propane tanks in, like, the middle of a \nmassive cornfield?  Is that a --   \nMS. SIMON:  No, we don't because we don't have \nany cornfields.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.\nMS. SIMON:  And most people who had propane \nonce upon a time probably converted a while ago.  We used to have -- \nas late at the 90s, there were five schools -- \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay. \nMS. SIMON:  -- in my neck of the woods in \nBrooklyn that was still heated by coal.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n108MR. BOLOGNA:  Okay. \nMS. SIMON:  So, they no longer are because coal is, \nin fact, very dirty. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Yeah, I could -- I could -- \nMS. SIMON:  So, that was a good decision.  But \npropane is not affected by this at all. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Well -- so, a lot of propane- \npowered houses in my neck of the woods are slowly trying to get to \nnatural gas, and what is happening is -- again, it's expensive, but the -- \nthe utility companies are actually slowly starting to get out to -- to \nthose regions.  I guess I would ask if you share my concern, in that \nnow that this will be taking place, is this a disincentive now for those \n-- for gas companies to come out, because they have fears that the \nresidents or their potential, you know, clients or ratepayers, will not \nwant to pay that extra, you know, for the line -- the -- beyond 100 \nfeet?  So, is there a dis -- is this not a disincentive to expand that \nservice?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, first of all, it's a matter of public \npolicy.  New York State has passed the CLCPA and we have a -- a \nClimate Action Plan, as you may know.  And so we have -- we have a \npublic policy to reduce the number of fossil fuels being used in New \nYork State because they are dangerous and they are harmful to -- to \nchildren and other living things.  So, the reality is that that is a bigger \npolicy.  Whether the comp -- the gas companies feel disincentivized or \nnot, I cannot answer for them.  All we are saying is, if it's a new \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n109connection, instead of you and I paying for your neighbor, your \nneighbor pays for that new connection. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  So I'm actually happy you brought \nup a term \"dangerous\" because that was actually gonna be my next \npoint.  So, in Western New York a couple years ago right on \nChristmas there was a blizzard. \nMS. SIMON:  Yes, I know. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  And 40-something-odd people \nperished in that blizzard.  And -- and one of the things that we learned \nfrom that was, in fact, that electricity is not as reliable in a life or \ndeath situation as natural gas.  So a -- a question would be why would \nwe want to -- is it not more dangerous that we're limiting people's \nability to afford modifying their home to natural gas than --  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, first of all, we are not limiting \ntheir ability to get to gas. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  We're making it more expensive. \nMS. SIMON:  I'm just saying, right?  If they live 101 \nfeet away, they're paying for that change anyway.  And chances are for \nmany people in rural Niagara County, they are farther away from a gas \nline than 100 hundred feet anyway.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. SIMON:  And so if they were doing that, that --  \nthey would pay that cost.  They would make that decision themselves, \nthey would look at their finances and they would decide whether they \ncould do that.  Right now if they were -- happened to be within 100 \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n110feet from the gas line, you and I would pay for it.  And we are saying \nthat, You know what?  You want gas, you want a new connection.  You \nthink that's better for you and your family.  Get the connection.  But \ndon't -- we shouldn't be bearing that cost . \nMR. BOLOGNA:  I -- I -- again, I understand the \npoint.  I -- I guess, you know, three-fourths, so, you know, 75 percent \nof people in this State want the ability to -- to choose natural gas.  And \nI -- I understand that this doesn't necessarily limit that.  But as the \nPeople's House, 75-plus percent of the people are telling us that they \nwant the ability to keep natural gas.  So I -- I guess it -- it's more in the \nwhat this bill says that -- that concerns me.  I guess is -- it's really not \na question, it's more of a statement. \nMS. SIMON:  So I'm not sure what the question is. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Because there wasn't one.  It was \njust a statement.\nMS. SIMON:  Okay.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  So I guess -- you know, thank you \nvery much for answering my questions.  I really appreciate it.\nMS. SIMON:  You're welcome.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Overall, there -- there are just a lot \nof concerns with this.  And again, I understand the -- the -- the portion \nof -- of self-reliance and having someone pay for something that they \nare doing theirselves [sic].  But that really should then start to filter in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n111the other parts of what we do here in the State Assembly.  \nA point was brought up earlier that -- that natural gas \nin West [sic] New York is cheaper than it is out on Long Island or in \n(indiscernible) Downstate.  Fine.  Then why is there not a carveout for \nWestern New York?  You know, people that I speak to back home \nhave serious concerns in this State about where our energy policies \nare.  And I think there is a tone deafness throughout the New York \nState, you know, government that Western New York is a very real \nand legitimate concern that our ability to have natural gas and keep \nnatural gas for emergency situations and just overall way of life is \nslowly being eroded.\nSo for those reasons I will be in the negative.  Thank \nyou very much. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Bailey. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMS. SIMON:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you very much.  I have a \ncouple of questions.  Specifically, what is the effective date of this \npiece of legislation?  \nMS. SIMON:  Immediately. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Immediately.  Okay.  So you have \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n112mentioned a couple times today that, you know, if projects are -- are \nstarted or done before the December 31st time frame that they would \nfall under this with the 100 foot -- you know, having the connection \nup to the residential.  Why are we doing this, then, if come December \n31st things are shifting?   \nMS. SIMON:  Because the All-Electric Buildings Act \nonly applies to new construction, right?  This applies to, let's say, a \nnew connection that might be new construction, but it also might be a \nconversion.  Let's say if you were converting from oil to natural gas, \nthis would affect you.  The All-Electric Buildings Act doesn't affect \nthat at all. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  Thank you for that answer, \nbecause that takes me into my next question.  \nMS. SIMON:  Mm-hmm.\nMRS. BAILEY:  So those projects -- you know, \nwe've talked quite a bit about, you know, rural Western New York.  \nThat is where I reside myself.  And we have some projects currently \nthat we have been trying to figure out how can we move them forward \nbecause we -- we do have a crisis when it comes to affordable housing \nin our area.  And we have a couple new housing developments going \nup; however, the grid, the electrical grid can't handle if -- if we were \nto move forward to the all-electric mandate that we're looking at \nDecember 31st.  So some of the answers to that was [sic] could we \npotentially use gas for some pieces to ensure that we have this \naffordable housing in our area.  So, unfortunately, when I read your \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n113legislation and as you just indicated with the -- the date of the \neffective piece, we're not gonna be able to do that. \nMS. SIMON:  Well, I would disagree because it's a \nphasing in of the All-Electric Buildings Act over two years.  So it's not \nan immediate happening on January 1, 2026.  So I was really more \nfocused on the issue of who would be doing the -- the connecting kind \nof thing.  So the All-Electric Buildings Act is phased in over a period \nof two years, and so it's -- it's not entirely the same situation that you \nlaid out. \nMRS. BAILEY:  But when we're looking at that and \nwe're talking affordable housing, I -- I look at it as, you know, \ndefinitely a barrier that we're gonna have in and around the hookup \npiece of it.  Because if now we're moving that -- that piece of, you \nknow, onto the homeowner or the new, you know, purchaser -- you \nknow, you indicated that you can't purchase a home for $100,000 \nanymore.  But we're looking at affordable housing in our area between \n$150- and $200,000.  That is inexpensive right now when you look at \nthe housing market.  So whether the expense is 7,500, 10,000, 2,000, \nit's going to incrementally be a handicap, potentially, for these \nindividuals that we're looking to move into those areas. \nMS. SIMON:  Well, in the situation you're talking \nabout now with projects under development, they would still be able \nto get gas.  They're not affected by the All-Electric Buildings Act.  \nAnd again, this bill only connects -- only affects who's paying for that \nconnection.  The reality is we're not costing people -- what -- what \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n114we're doing is not costing you and I for the cost of somebody else \nputting in a connection.  That is all this does.  Right now those -- those \nconnections are not subsidized by the company, they are subsidized by \nthe other ratepayers.  And so the reality is that's not actually affecting \nthe affordability of housing.  And afford -- housing affordability is \ngoing up because of a variety of reasons, as you know, and it is going \nup all over the State.  They certainly have -- you would have no idea -- \nI can't rent, you know, a parking space for under $7,000 a year.  So \nbig difference in costs, but those costs are all going up.  And they're \ngoing up even more in certain parts of the State than Western New \nYork.  So you guys are doing good that way. \nMRS. BAILEY:  So I guess, you know, kind of back \nto what my colleague had indicated, you know, when you look at \nregionalities of the State, you know, all too often, you know, we have \none-size-fits-all.  So did we look at any projects that are out there \nacross the State and how this may or may not impact those projects \nthat are currently going on?  \nMS. SIMON:  I'm not looking at projects because \nlooking at projects is irrelevant to this bill.  This bill simply says if \nyou're -- if you're in a -- in a -- trying to determine whether you can do \na project, you should know, have information beforehand about what \nyour costs may be.  So if this bill passes and it's signed by the \nGovernor, that person who is making that decision needs to know \nwhat -- what the -- the field is.  They need to know what they might be \npaying for.  This is something that will not cost -- catch people \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n115abruptly, right?  So the reality is that this is not going to increase the \ncost of building a house dramatically, because right now the costs are \nthe same.  It's just that you and I are paying for them as opposed to the \nperson putting in that connection. \nMRS. BAILEY:  We're paying for a lot in New York \nState. \nMS. SIMON:  We are.  I agree. \nMRS. BAILEY:  So as far as -- you know, I -- I will \nrespectfully agree to disagree.  I -- I believe that this is going to have a \nnegative impact on -- on different developments that are in \nconsideration right now and are, you know, looking to start, you \nknow, breaking ground here before the end of the year. \nMS. SIMON:  Good. \nMRS. BAILEY:  It's gonna have a negative impact on \nthem. \nMS. SIMON:  It won't, because all it does it says, you \nknow, This project, you're going to pay for that connection .  Right \nnow you and I are paying for that connection.  We're saving New \nYork's ratepayers $200 million a year that we are bearing because \nother people are putting in a connection, a new connection within 100 \nfeet.  And all we're saying is that should be borne by the person \nputting in that connection. \nMRS. BAILEY:  And I think we're gonna be talking \nabout a bill here shortly that -- that -- it's interesting that you've \nindicated that.  But as far as this piece goes, I -- I really am struggling \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n116with the fact that it won't increase the cost to build these new homes.  \nBecause that -- that is now going back on to the individual who \nthought they were gonna have a gas line brought in, which now they're \ngonna be told that the Governor just signed this bill, it's effective \nimmediately.  Now you are responsible for that expense. \nMS. SIMON:  If your project is already underway, it \nwon't be affected.  If it's new, post-signature that would be different.  \nBut the cost itself of that connection, if the connection let's say is \n$7,000.  That $7,000 is not gonna change.  What will change is who's \npaying the $7,000.  Instead of you or I, it'll be the person putting in the \nconnection.  If it's only within 100 feet.  If it's 101 feet, they're paying \nit anyway. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you very much.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMRS. BAILEY:  I thank the sponsor for taking my \nquestions, and actually there's a lot of concern with this bill.  You \nknow, I really question why are we discussing it today on -- on June \n16th when -- when we look at, you know, come December 31st we're \n-- we're moving into, you know, all-electric when we're looking at \nthis.  This will definitely have a negative impact on my district on \nprojects that are in the works right now.  I find it interesting, you \nknow, every -- you know, everyone needs electricity.  Not everyone \nneeds gas.  I remember the -- the ice storm of '91.  Everyone \ndescended on my -- at my mother's house.  And the reason why is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n117because she had a gas stove.  So guess what?  We were able to \ncontinue to -- to cook, to eat and -- and carry on.  I worked at a local \npizzeria at the same time.  We were able to feed the crews, the \nlinemen, when they came into town because we had gas ovens.  So we \nwere able to use the product that was in the walk-in coolers, and we \nwere able to use that.  We didn't lose that, and we were able to then \ncontribute back to the folks who were out there getting the electric \nturned back on.  \nWe have really gotta take a look at this.  You know, \nwhat might be good for one area is going to be catastrophic for \nanother, and we are seeing that.  We see that every day in Western \nNew York where we have the push for the solar, for the wind.  You \nknow, I -- I just saw, you know, Good Morning America this morning.  \nThey were in their new building.  I didn't see solar panels on top of -- \non tops of their building top.  I saw artificial grass that they could go \nout and stand on.  \nWe have opportunities to make this right for New \nYork State, and we're doing everything we can to make it \nunaffordable.  You know, the sponsor indicated utilities doesn't [sic] \npay for anything.  It comes back to you and I.  I just want to leave this \nbill with that premise in mind, because I think that that will be a \ncaveat into a bill we're gonna discuss here in a little bit.  Because at \nthe end of the day, it -- it all depends on whose argument you want to \nargue.  It all comes back to the taxpayer, for the most part.  And I \nthink until we admit that and we can see that, but look at it in totality. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n118Let's look at what we're doing from that 30,000-mile mark -- or foot \nmark, and look down.  Because piecemealing different pieces are \ngoing to continue to hurt Upstate New York, and we really need to \nlook at that. \nMadam Speaker, for all of these reasons I will be no \non this piece of legislation.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  Will the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  A couple of questions. \nMS. SIMON:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Actually, I was just \nlooking at the section of the bill that's gonna -- this bill is gonna \nchange.  Section 1, it amends the subdivision 4 of Section 31 of the \nPublic Service Law that removes the requirement that the first 100 \nfeet of new gas connections is paid for by the utility company.  So is \nthe notion of your bill that if the utility company has to pay for it, \nthey're simply gonna spread the rate out across all -- anybody who \npays for gas?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Okay.  That's clearer.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n119So in your estimation, has there been any utility that has spread its \nservices that did not connect the rate to all of the people who were \nparticipating?  \nMS. SIMON:  No. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  No.  And -- and I -- I -- I \nbring that up because I remember when I was, I want to say 15 or 16, \nand my father pointed out to me on our phone bill this fee that was -- \nhad just been added.  He was explaining to me why this was added.  I \nsaid, Well, what do you mean by that?   He said, Well, a lot of these \nlines for the phone service are not in rural areas yet, and in order to \nget them there you have to have workers and they have to go out and \nbuild it.  And so everybody has to pay the cost for that.  And so I'm \ngonna assume that cable, electricity and gas and everything else went \nthat same model.  And what your bill is trying to do is transform that \nmodel to one who -- everybody who's a ratepayer doesn't have to pay \nfor this person to have a new home connected to gas, but only that \nperson who has the new home has to pay for this rate.  Just that \nperson. \nMS. SIMON:  They pay for the connection.  The rates \nthemselves are --\nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  They pay for the \nconnection. \nMS. SIMON:  Many other things, yes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  So I won't have to pay \nfor the connection to get a new home built in rural East Aurora.  That \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n120person who's building the home would have to pay for that. \nMS. SIMON:  Yes, just the connection. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Who would have to pay \nfor their sewer sys -- sewer -- connection to the sewer system?  Would \nI have to pay for that?  \nMS. SIMON:  The -- no.  Right now if you connect to \nthe sewer system, the new builder, the homeowner who is putting that \nin pays for that. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  So this is yet another \ncost to the new homebuilder that, much like they pay for their own \nsewage connection, their own water connection, they're gonna have to \npay for their own gas connection as well. \nMS. SIMON:  Right. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you.  I appreciate \n(indiscernible).\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  I -- I -- people often \nmention when they're having these discussions the horrific wind and \nsnowstorm that happened in Buffalo in 2022.  And people died as a \nresult of it.  It was really, really bad because people lost electricity in \nsome areas.  And if your electricity is -- is keeping your heater going, \nthen you lost heat as well.  Well, I didn't lose either.  And I only have \nelectric appliances in my home.  I did find a way to get my family \nfrom where they were where they didn't have access to anything, and I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n121literally became a short-order cook for a week.  I cooked everything \nthat was in my freezer because everything still worked.  And I'm not \nsuggesting that it's not a bad idea to go to electricity, because \neventually we may get there.  But I am suggesting that we have to \nmake sure that there's -- the grid has a capacity to go there.  And if the \ngrid had had the capacity in 2022 when we had that horrific storm, \npeople wouldn't have died.  And so I think it's fair that, you know, \npeople who want to add fossil fuel gas to their new beautiful home, I \nthink they should pay for it.  If I had an opportunity to build a new, \nbeautiful home I would want to go in a place where they did have the \ncapacity for electric grid.  And I would go electric, because in -- at the \nend of the day, not only is it gonna be less expensive, but it's also \ngoing to be better for our environment, and perhaps we will stop \nhaving those horrific wind and snowstorms that take people out.  \nAnd so I am appreciating the transformation of this \nbill.  I also want to mention that there have been at least two new \ndevelopments in my district.  They're clearly affordable homes.  \nThey're in some cases high-rises, in some cases townhouses, and \nthey're all being built 100 percent electric.  Some of them have already \nstarted to move people in.  And so if -- if people don't think it's \npossible to do affordable housing around -- with electricity, it is \npossible.  Because it's actually happening now and it happens to be \ngoing on with public housing.  \nAnd so I -- I think there's a lot of things that \neventually will change in this society, as most things do at some point.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n122Nothing stays the same.  In fact, electricity used to be the number one \nthing that we used to move around in this country.  But at some point \nthe fossil fuel business, gas companies came along and they won the \nbattle.  They won the fight.  They won the debate.  And they took over \nwhat electricity was doing.  In fact, I can't call our President's name, \nbut I do know that he was shot at the Pan-Am Exposition.  He went to \nthe hospital in an ambulance that was run by electricity.  It wasn't run \nby gas.  And so we're going full circle in society, and it's -- it's a \nchallenge for a lot of us to go because it's different.  And it's not the \nbusiness that we're in.  And it's not the thing that we would like to see \nhappen right now.  But I think if we begin to speak more to each other \nabout how we get to a place where the Superintendent of our \nDepartment of Financial Services isn't telling us that multiple billions \nof dollars in taxpayer dollars are being used -- used to deal with \nweather-related events that happened in New York State.  We'll get to \na point where insurance companies are not providing insurance to \npeople anymore in certain places because of -- there are so many \nweather events, they can't afford it.  \nSo at some point we got to figure out how to get to \nthis.  I think this is a step.  I want to congratulate the sponsor on \ncoming to it, and I hope that we can make this at least happen.  Thank \nyou. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Chang. \nMR. CHANG:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n123On the bill itself. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. CHANG:  As I hear from our colleagues and the \nsponsor of this bill that we save ratepayers about over $200 million \nbecause the connection itself, I think that's kind of disingenuous, too.  \nBecause we subsidize solar and -- and wind power, and just for \nNYSERDA , we subsidize over $3.3 billion just for wind power and \nmany, many more billions for solar power.  And it costs fossil fuel to \nmake these equipment.  So Upstate New York need alternative energy \nbecause their way they're structured rural.  I live in urban, and we do \n-- we're fortunate that we have both electric and gas been installed for \n40 or 50 years it's been established.  Gas is not subsidized by itself.  \nBut connection, yes, by ratepayers.  But the subsidies that we pay for \non solar power and wind is all taxes, because the tax credit -- it's not \njust the ratepayer, but the taxpayer of New York State pays for that for \nsubsidies.  Why not eliminate them and see what the market forces \nare?  Those renewable energies are very costly.  More costly than \nfossil fuel, and it will affect our economy because of those costs. \nCurrent technology, if we want to be more efficient \nand less fossil fuel is really nuclear.  Nuclear new technology is more \nsafer than before, than 30, 40 years ago.  Right now current \ntechnology it is.  I don't know in my lifetime the best, most reliable \nand fossil fuel free energy would be fusion.  But I don't know why \nable to live that to see that in the commercial field.  So we have to \nbalance on energy needs for our Upstate brethren, because electric is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n124not reliable.  Gas can, because gas is -- gas pipeline is basically \nunderground.  Most of our electric field are aboveground, not \nunderground.  That's why it's subject to weather.  That's why it's not \nreliable.  It is most unfortunate, and it's sad for certain area have \nadverse weather effects that affects their electric -- electric power.  \nCertain -- certain weather forecast.  But right now this current system \nof balancing -- of subsidizing of the gas connection should be in play, \nespecially for Upstate New York.  And until nuclear or fusion comes \nout, then that will be the best reliable energy. \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMs. Gallagher. \nMS. GALLAGHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. GALLAGHER:  My colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle act as if this is a radical bill.  In reality, it is an exceedingly \nmodest compromise.  It is still the first step and it is worth doing.  But \nlet us be clear:  It is the bare minimum.  New York has bold climate \ngoals as outlawed by State law -- as outlined by State law, but \nsomewhere between touting the goals and doing the work required to \nmeet them, we lose the will to commit.  \nWe are facing an existential climate crisis.  2024 was \nthe hottest year on record.  Our air quality has been moderately to \ndangerously unhealthy because of raging Canadian wildfires that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n125would have been unthinkable a few years ago.  Now they are an \nannual event.  Utility companies continue to raise their height -- hike \ntheir rates, forcing ratepayers to pick up the tab to repair and deliver \nantiquated gas infrastructure.  The status quo is not sustainable.  My \nconstituents write to me every week, talking about the increases in \ntheir utility costs.  People are forced to choose between paying their \nutility bills and putting food on the table.  The thing that industry \ndoesn't want our constituents to understand is that these costs are \ngoing to keep rising year over year because the industry is choosing to \nraise the bills.  They continue to replace infrastructure that should be \nretired in locations where renewable energy is available and is less \nexpensive.  We will hopefully address this in the years to come. \nThe reason why is simple; New York's gas \ninfrastructure is old.  It is leak prone and it is out of alignment with \nNew York's laws and climate goals.  It is a short-sighted policy to \nhave ratepayers to pay to repair aging, leak-prone gas infrastructure, \neven as we know that we must transition to electric as a matter of New \nYork law and mitigating the worst effects of climate change.  This bill \nwill not address that.  It will only ensure that ratepayers no longer are \nforced to pay for new hookups with new gas lines within 100 feet.  It \nis a modest solution that will save ratepayers money and begin to \ntransition us to a future where our constituents no longer pay for life- \nthreatening infrastructure.  \nThe reason there is confusion about what this bill will \ndo, as well as the efficiency and breadth of new, sustainable and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n126reliable technology available in 2025 is because as we've seen for \ndecades, the fossil fuel industry is willing to spend obscene amounts \nof money and perpetuate false narratives to -- to protect their profits, \neven as they undeniably know about the suffering and damage their \nproducts will cause.  It is shameful and we must not fall for this \npropaganda.  \nThis bill, minimal as it is, will save ratepayers in my \ndistrict $99 million each year.  As the years ago on the savings will \ngrow.  It will create a path to ending our addiction to gas energy, \nwhich is only going to become increasingly expensive and dangerous. \nI am proud to vote in the affirmative for this bill.  I \nwill continue to fight alongside the sponsor to end the obligation to \nserve, and to cap the rates for low-income New Yorkers.  Our abilities \nto do so will determine how liveable the future is for generations to \ncome.  Your children, your grandchildren and your great- \ngrandchildren depend on us getting this right. \nI thank the sponsor for her work, her common sense, \nand for her courage.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  So I've been listening to the debate \ntoday, and I -- I just find it so amusing that the sponsor rhetorically \nasks should you pay for your own connection or should all ratepayers, \nright?  So -- and I think it's interesting because the -- the concept is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n127should all ratepayers pay as an idea of, like, a greater social goal or a \nsocial utility, or should the individual have to pay.  And it's very \ninteresting, the position that's taken by the sponsor and by the previous \nspeaker and by members of the Majority that they want so many other \nthings to be free or extremely reduced.  And I just started jotting down \na quick list.  Here we go:  Free healthcare, including everything under \nthe sun covered under the Medicaid program.  Free birth control.  Free \ncollege.  Free housing or rent.  Free menstrual products.  Free \nchildcare.  Free school lunches.  Free legal aid, representation in court.  \nFree preschool.  Free translation services.  Free food under SNAP, \nWIC, EBT.  We're gonna take up a bill a little bit later looking for a \nportion of the Thruway near Syracuse to be free.  Tax credits for green \nenergy initiatives, having kids, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  But on \nthis one, on this bill we want the homeowner to pay.  The homeowner \nneeds to step up and pay for themselves.  So -- as an upfront cost, and \nthat's on top of all the other upfront costs that people have to pay in \norder to own their own home; their closing costs and -- and everything \nelse.  It has never, my friends, been harder for New Yorkers to own \ntheir own homes, and -- and this bill is gonna make it even harder.  So \nif I can put words in the -- the mouths of those who support this bill I \nwould say housing crisis?  What housing crisis?  \nIf this bill becomes a law, we will all know for sure \nwhat some of us already suspect:  That the Majority's so-called \naffordability agenda for New Yorkers is a joke.  I vote no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Ra. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n128MR. RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMS. SIMON:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. RA:  Thank you.  So if we can just go back for a \nminute, because I think at the end of the day you're right.  The bill \nlanguage itself is -- is short in what it does, but we obviously need to \nthink about how this interacts with the other policies that have been \nbrought forward.  And I think it's fairly obvious that one of those \nthings that we need to keep in mind is how it interacts with all-electric \nbuildings and the process that is ongoing with regard to coming forth \nwith -- with regulations for that, and I think we just finished kind of a \ncomment period with regard to that.  \nSo what this bill does, as you said, is it says the \n100-foot rule, which -- which has the utility cover that cost if you're \nwithin 100 feet, is -- is repealed, and now it's up to the developer or \nthe homeowner to pay for that cost, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, I would disagree in that I didn't \nsay the utility will pay, because the reality is the utility passes that cost \non to all of the ratepayers in the form of delivery charges, which is \nwhere they get ratepayers coming and going to subsidize just about all \nof their costs and, in fact, some of their rate hikes include additional \nreturn to shareholders on their equity.  So we're paying for everything \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n129including the shareholder equity. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So you said the savings, then, of not \ndoing this any longer is $200 million?  \nMS. SIMON:  The estimate's for the State, Statewide, \nthat ratepayers are bearing for the new connections within 100 feet of \nthe gas line --\nMR. RA:  Uh-huh.\nMS. SIMON:  -- amount to about 200 million a year.  \nThat would now not be passed on to ratepayers, but would be borne by \nthe person who is doing that developing. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  Now, do you know how many \nresidential natural gas customers there are in New York State?\nMS. SIMON:  I don't off the top of my head, but they \nare declining.  Thirteen percent of New Yorkers have chosen \nsomething else over -- since 2019. \nMR. RA:  Well, six out of ten New Yorkers rely on \nnat -- natural gas to heat their homes and we'll get to that in a minute.  \nBut there's currently over 4.5 million residential nat -- natural gas \ncustomers in New York State.  So if you do the math, that's about $44 \nper customer, which is, you know, a few -- few bucks a month.  Now, \nI don't shake a stick at saving any ratepayer any money, but we have \nto think about what the overall cost is.  We -- too often with these \npolicies we -- we think in tunnel vision, and we don't think about what \nthe impacts are, say, when you do make connecting a home more \nexpensive.  Now, I would assume at this point if we are getting into \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n130implementing the All-Electric Buildings Act that we're gonna mostly \nbe talking about converting an -- an existing home with regard to this, \nright?  Because if you can't connect new -- if the new -- new \ndevelopments aren't gonna be able to -- new construction is not gonna \nbe able to have natural gas anyway, wouldn't we largely be talking \nabout existing homes?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, existing customers of -- who \nhave natural gas aren't affected by this at all.  All that will do is that \nthey will have slightly lower rates. \nMR. RA:  No, I'm not talking about existing \ncustomers in their homes.  I'm -- what I'm talking about is not new \nconstruction, but somebody moves into a home and, say, is trying to \nreplace with natural gas a heating system that is far less efficient and \nfar less green than what they would have with natural gas.  Aren't we \ntalking about really those homeowners who may be trying to replace \noil heat in a home?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes.  As I mentioned, somebody who \nis doing that work would pay for the connection as opposed to you \nand I. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So maybe you disagree with this, \nbut it seems to me that we are then making it more expensive for \nsomebody who wants to replace oil, which is far less clean, far worse \nfor the environment, with natural gas which is cheaper and more green \nand better for the environment. \nMS. SIMON:  Well, it's certainly more green than oil, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n131which is not saying a lot.  That's a low bar.  But the reality is, in fact, \nif you are -- when you calculate in your conversion plan, right, you \nwould now know that if you're within 100 feet, and many people are \nnot within 100 feet, if you're within 100 feet you would pay for that \ninitial connection.  You would also save an awful lot of money \nbecause oil is more expensive. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So let's say I'm in -- you know, and \nobviously this is gonna vary throughout the State.  Some of our \nUpstate colleagues, this may be very different from -- from where \nyou're from or where I'm from in Western Long Island where, you \nknow, it's certainly not -- \nMS. SIMON:  Cheap.\nMR. RA:  The homes aren't as close together as they \nare maybe in your district, but they're certainly far closer than -- than \nmany others' districts.  So say -- do -- is there an average cost of what \nwe're talking about here if, say, I move into -- I purchase a home that \nhas gas -- that has oil and I want to convert it to gas and say I'm 50 \nfeet, 75 feet from a main.  Do -- do you have any sense of what that \ncost is now?  \nMS. SIMON:  It's going to depend on your utility and \nwhat those rates are for that utility.  And I have not -- there are many, \nmany utility companies, and I haven't assessed how much they would \ncharge for such a -- that particular hypothetical.  But if you are closer, \nobviously it's cheaper than if you're farther away.  If you're farther \naway, of course you're paying for a new connection anyway. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n132MR. RA:  Do -- do you know for any?  Like, for -- \nfor Con Edison, for National Grid, for any of those Downstate \nentities?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, let me just explain that National \n-- that ConEd has requested a new rate hike, as you may be aware, \nright?  And they estimate that the cost of the -- the cost of the new \nconnections to gas within the 100 feet is roughly $70 million in the \nfirst year.  It's a $1 billion rate hike, and that cost is about 70 million.  \nSo ConEd would charge roughly the cost per foot for a gas line \ninstallation in 2021, so I don't have newer data, is about $710 per foot \nfor ConEd.  Orange and Rockland is $59, very different.  Central \nHudson, 133.  National Grid Upstate is $53.  In New York City it's \n$370.  On Long Island it's 67.  NYSEG is 89.  Rochester Gas and \nElectric is 30 and National Fuel Gas is 18.  So it's much, much \ncheaper to have gas in Western New York. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So I want to get back into, you \nknow, the interplay between all-electric buildings and how this works.  \nSo, as I said, six in ten New Yorkers heat their homes with -- with \nnatural gas.  Now, in the process that is going on right now with -- \nwith the PSC, I believe, buildings are going to be exempt from the ban \non fossil fuels under the All-Electric Buildings [sic] if electric service \ncannot be reasonably provided by the grid.\nMS. SIMON:  Right.\nMR. RA:  Now, they're going to de -- they're going \nthrough a process right now of determining what that means.  We \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n133have basically a situation if this is enacted into law where you will \ncontinue to be able to get connected to electricity and that will not be \nborne by -- by the homeowners looking to be connected.  But if it's \nnatural gas, it is borne by the homeowner.  Is -- is there any provisions \nwith regard to this if -- if we're in a situation and a development is \ngoing on and they're getting exempt from All-Electric Buildings \nbecause they're saying they can't reasonably be connected with \nadequate electric service to provide heat and appliances and all the \ntype of things we're asking them to do, is there any exemption that \nwould allow them to -- to still get a connection if they're within 100 \nfeet that is paid for by the utility or covered by the utility?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes, in a word.  But also, you should \nremember that most exemptions from the All-Electric Buildings Act \nwill be commercial. \nMR. RA:  Okay, so -- but under this, if it's a \nresidential development.\nMS. SIMON:  Under this, under -- under the \nAll-Electric Buildings Act or under --   \nMR. RA:  No, under this bill.\nMS. SIMON:  I'm not prepared to discuss that.\nMR. RA:  Under this bill, if it's a residential \ndevelopment and it's been determined that, you know, to do \neverything they need to do in a building they're going to -- it -- there's \njust is -- the grid can't currently support it. \nMS. SIMON:  Okay.  They don't have to go electric, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n134right?  They can still get gas if it's -- if it's too hard to electrify.  There \nare parts of the State where it's very hard to electrify.  Nobody is \nchange -- challenging that in any way. \nMR. RA:  Well, I would agree.  But isn't the intention \nof this bill to push people towards electrification as opposed to \nhooking up to natural gas?  \nMS. SIMON:  It is the intention of this bill to not \nforce your neighbors to pay for a new connection to the utility. \nMR. RA:  But --\nMS. SIMON:  That is the intent of the bill.\nMR. RA:  But if it's electrification, we -- we will \ncontinue to force them to pay. \nMS. SIMON:  Well, a new connection might be done \nin an area where we're -- on a new building.  It has to be new \nconstruction.  And so if you're -- you gave the example of converting \nfrom oil.  That would be a new gas connection.  That would be \npermitted. \nMR. RA:  Well, no, that's what I was talking about \nearlier.  Now I'm talking about a -- a new development with regard to \nthe All-Electric Buildings Act and this -- this bill.\nMS. SIMON:  That's not what this is -- this bill is \nabout.  \nMR. RA:  Okay.  \nMS. SIMON:  You'd have to find the exemption from \nthe All-Electric Buildings Act, not from this. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n135MR. RA:  Well, what I'm saying is there may be \nprovision -- there may be a situation where we're -- through that Act \nwe're telling a new development they have to be all-electric, but we're \n-- we're essentially, with this bill, I think trying to push everybody \ntowards electric, where we -- I could see -- I think it's foreseeable \nthere's a situation where -- where there's a development that is -- \nthey're both in a situation where, you know, we're increasing the cost \nof building that housing because of what we're doing here today, but \nthey're also being told, Hey, you really -- we can't reasonably provide \nyou all of the power you're gonna need to heat and cook and all those \ntypes of things . \nMS. SIMON:  If, in fact, they cannot provide that \nwhich would be -- make this building electrified in a way that is \nsustainable, reliable, et cetera, you could still get gas.  That's an \nexemption, right?  Just because most of them will be commercial \ndoesn't mean all of them will be commercial.  That's gonna be based \non the facts and circumstances, and the utility and the Public Service \nCommission are the ones who are in a better position to know what \nthose are than you or I. \nMR. RA:  Thank -- thank you, Madam Sponsor.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. RA:  Thank you.  So I -- I will end kind of \nwhere I started, which is too often we have tunnel vision on -- on \nthese things.  Trying to move ourselves in a direction of being greener \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n136is generally a good thing.  But we can't do things that we're not \ntechnologically ready to do.  The grid cannot support what we've been \ntrying to do in this State at the pace we've been trying to do it.  And it \nalways comes back to, as far as I -- any time I talk to a constituent, it's \naffordability and it's reliability.  And we can't reliably convert all of \nour State to elec -- electric.  We have really, scientifically, a problem \nwith regard to the fact that we have parts of our State that get very, \nvery cold in the winter.  Heat pumps and things like that just are not \nadequate in those situations.  And I hope this isn't the case, but there is \nthe very real possibility that people will pay for that policy failure if \nwe make it, with their lives. \nNow, I want to just talk about the concept -- we've \ntalked about we don't want people having to subsidize other people's \nnatural gas hookups.  I started looking back, and I think in the last \nmonth alone -- and I know NYSERDA  already has tons of rebate \nprograms for all kinds of different things which are -- which are paid \nfor at the end of the day by the ratepayer.  But just in the last few \nweeks we moved a bill through committee for rebates for \nzero-emission vehicles, a NYSERDA  rebate program.  A new \nNYSERDA  rebate program for residential heat pumps.  A new \nNYSERDA  rebate program for battery-powered lawn care equipment.  \nA new NYSERDA  rebate program for insulation.  And there have \nbeen others.  I -- I think we had a bill for used electric cars.  All of \nthose things are things that are being subsidized by the rest of the \nratepayers in New York State.  So let's be honest.  It's not that we have \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n137a problem with -- with that, it's that we have a problem with it because \nwe want to get rid of natural gas despite the fact that it is the only way \nwe can continue to keep this State running, make sure we have \nadequate electricity and can adequately heat our homes. \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Morinello.  \nMR. MORINELLO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill, sir. \nMR. MORINELLO:  What I find quite interesting \nand puzzling, this bill seems to indicate that they want to save \ntaxpayers money by basically putting them in a position where if they \nwant gas like their neighbors, they have to pay for it in the first 100 \nyards [sic].  That's fine, if that was the actual true purpose.  But let's \ntake your electric bills.  And I'm gonna ask everyone in this Chamber \nwhen they go home, look at your electric bill and look at the \ntransportation and surcharges.  On -- at least in Western New York, \nthe transportation and surcharges in some instances are 70 percent of \nyour total electric bill.  And when you inquire what's it for, it's to build \nout the electric grid.  So the concept that the first 100 feet is gonna \nsave taxpayers money, it actually doesn't hold up if you compare it to \nthe goal of all-electric.  When you look at that electric bill, you realize \nevery single electric ratepayer in this State is subsidizing a build-out \nfor the lofty goals of this particular State.  So it's really -- if we're \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n138gonna do that, then why don't we become transparent on the \ntransportation and surcharges on our electric bills?  Let's show the \nratepayers what they are paying for this build-out of an electric grid \nthat has been proven is as impossible to support the needs and that we \ndo need additional fuels.  Even our Governor has stated that we need \nto start looking at additional fuels, and she did mini -- mention mini \nnuclear.  They've talked about hydrogen.  So this move to allegedly \nsave taxpayers money really doesn't hold water. \nLet's go a little bit more.  They claim it'll save 200 \nmillion, yet the estimate -- and it keeps going up -- for the build-out of \ntotal electric is right now one-quarter trillion.  Two hundred million \npales in comparison to the two.  So we really and truly, those of us \nwho are not afraid to say it, know what this is for.  This is just another \npush by the highest-taxed state in the nation, the 49th in business \nclimate, the 49th friendliest to consumers, to push another burden \nupon them to accomplish their goal of total electric, which we all \nknow.  \nYou know, if you look at some of the old movies \nfrom the 60s and 70s and Flash Gordon, go on and look at them.  \nLook at the landscapes where they looked like our country; our farms \nare starting to look with solar panels and windmills.  And what you \nneed is, in order to go to all-electric you need these.  But there's no \nplan.  What do you do with a solar panel that's full of chemicals that \nwe're trying to ban in other bills?  What do you do with the leaks on \nthe windmills of the hydraulic fluids that are going into the ground?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n139What do you do with the blades that are non-recyclable?  You find a \ndesert in the Midwest that's there and you bring them and you \ndeposited them there.  Or you go to Japan and you ask to put your \nsolar panels on the island that they have built.  So why don't we just \nstop talking about \"this is a three-line bill and it's only to save \ntaxpayer money\", and let's get real about what we're doing here.  And \none of our colleagues mentioned wildfires in Canada.  Well, if you \nread the reports, that's because the environmentalists will not allow \nproper forest management, cleaning out the brush.  Last year's \nwildfire, the Premier would not allow a fire break to be built which \nwould have taken down a line of trees to stop the fire because of the \nenvironmentalists.  \nSo all I'm saying is, let's start being truthful.  Let's tell \nthe people what we're really doing.  And it's really strange because \nthis piece today was pulled out of a larger bill, but they know they \ncan't do it.  I call this Legislature \"ceramic nippers.\"  A nipper is a \nsmall tool that when you're putting ceramic tile in you cut little pieces \nout in edges.  And that's what this Body has been doing in my nine \nyears here.  They can't get their goal, so they started nipping.  This bill \nis a nip at a larger bill.  So my only position is let's start being truly \nhonest.  Let's not lie to the people.  Let's not lie to ourselves.  Let's be \nhonest.  Let's talk about what it is.  And on the electric surcharges and \nthe electric transmission, let's tell the people how much of that bill is \nused to build out the -- the grid.  They're still paying for it.\nBecause of all of that I am in the negative, and I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n140suggest my colleagues vote no on this bill.  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Manktelow. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Ms. Simon.  Well, \nsome of my questions have been answered, but back to the dollars and \ncents of the bill.  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  You said that this would save \n$200 million across the State?  \nMS. SIMON:  Across the State ratepayers.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Ratepayers.\nMS. SIMON:  Ratepayers.  Gas ratepayers.  \nMm-hmm. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So one of the colleagues just a \nlittle while ago said that in their district it would save their district $99 \nmillion just in that one district. \nMS. SIMON:  They've got a lot of gas lines there.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Okay.  So --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n141MS. SIMON:  But I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not relying \non that number.  \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Okay.\nMS. SIMON:  I'm relying on the number that the -- \nthe PSC has given us and we've estimated. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Yeah, because I've been doing \nthe math on that number, and in one district that's half of your 200 \nmillion -- \nMS. SIMON:  I know, but that's -- that's not -- that's \nnot the point of the bill, right?  \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So that wasn't a good number, \nthen?  \nMS. SIMON:  I don't know.  I don't know where she \ngot it from, but I'm not gonna endorse it or not. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Okay.\nMS. SIMON:  I'm just telling you what we have \nestimated Statewide. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  And I appreciate the -- the job \nyou're trying to do by saving all the ratepayers money where I don't \nhave to pay for yours, you don't have to pay for mine.  I completely \nunderstand that.  I wish, as one of my colleagues had said earlier, that \nwe would consider that across the board; whether it's electric, whether \nit's, in this bill, gas.  I think if we're truly going to do that and really \nlook out for the -- the ratepayers, as you said, I believe we should do it \nacross the board.  Do you?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n142MS. SIMON:  Well, I would say that if we were \ngoing to do as much as we could for ratepayers, we would have passed \nthe New York HEAT Act; however, this is a just a 100-foot rule \nwhich saves us a certain amount of money.  And the reality is some of \nthese rate increases, like ConEd just recently had a rate increase.  That \nrate increase is all about replacing and repairing fossil fuels.  And the \nfossil fuel industry generates a lot of electricity.  So, you know, some \nof the arguments that are being made I think are somewhat misplaced. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Okay.  I appreciate you taking \nthe time just to answer my couple of questions. \nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  As my colleague just said \nearlier, you know, we really need to take a hard look at transparency \nand really what's going on.  And one of my concerns here is we're \ntrying to do this across New York State; it's already been said.  But \nI'm gonna add to it.  We have had blizzards.  We have had ice storms.  \nWe have had everything possible you can think of.  That's never going \nto go away.  \nMy neighbors are Amish.  They have no electricity at \nall, other than a solar portion that they charge up a cell phone with.  \nThey burn wood.  And why am I saying this?  Because it's their \nchoice.  Just like us, I want to protect my family.  I want to protect my \nchildren, my grandchildren, my mother.  Seniors.  Let us have the \nability to make that decision.  Not we as legislators, but we as \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n143individuals in New York State here in America.  And what we're \ndoing here is we're saying that if you want to hook up natural gas to \nyour house, we're gonna charge you just a little bit more than not \ncharging this individual down the street that wants electric.  \nAgain, I think we're all in favor of cleaning up our \nenvironment using electricity to do as much as we possibly can.  I did \nthe math.  I've talked to RG&E.  I've talked to NYSEG.  I've talked \nacross the board.  It is not doable in the time frame that we're looking \nat.  So instead of hurting people that are gonna have to rely on natural \ngas for probably the rest of my life, we need to help them as well.  \nAnd we're not doing that.  It -- it sounds good on paper, it looks good.  \nBut in reality, in real life that's not the way it works.  And I want a \nfamily to have the ability to decide what's best for them, not New \nYork State making that decision.  And we've heated a lot of food on a \ngas grill.  And if we didn't have that, we'd have been in trouble.  We \nheated our house with a wood stove.  Choices that we make.  I'm all \nfor electricity, but we have to look at the safety aspect of it, Madam \nSpeaker, giving us the choice as Americans. \nSo thank you for allowing me to just say a few things \non this.  I thank the sponsor for answering my questions.  Thank you \nvery much.  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Giglio. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for a few --  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n144ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. SIMON:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Thank you.  So, there have been \nexisting homes that have been waiting for a gas line to go in front of \ntheir house in order to be able to connect to gas, and they've been \nwaiting a long time.  There's been moratoriums on gas connections.  A \nlot of things, a lot of hurdles.  And people want to convert to gas \nbecause it's less expensive and cleaner than oil. \nMS. SIMON:  True. \nMS. GIGLIO:  So now those people that have been in \na line and in a pattern waiting for natural gas, are those people, they're \n-- they're no longer eligible for the 100-foot connection?  If they have \nthe 100-foot connection, if they've been in the hopper and they just \nhaven't had the opportunity to connect to gas?  \nMS. SIMON:  If they -- I -- I would suggest that that \nmight be something that the utility might work out with that -- that \nperson.  But the -- the bill itself doesn't address that particular \ninstance.  However, obviously the cost of that connection is the cost of \nthat connection, and the question is who it's borne by. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  So we're going to be \nsubsidizing electric connections but we're not subsidizing the gas \nconnections anymore, correct?  \nMS. SIMON:  We are currently subsidizing all \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n145ratepayers both of those things.  This would not eliminate the \nsubsidizing of -- of gas service.  It is only the initial connection --\nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  Well -- \nMS. SIMON:  -- that -- it would be borne by \nratepayers instead of the individual. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  So say I want to build a new \nhouse.  Is --\nMS. SIMON:  (Indiscernible)\nMS. GIGLIO:  Are the appliances more expensive, \nelectric appliances more expensive than gas appliances, and are they \nmore expensive to run?  \nMS. SIMON:  Well, that's a -- a big question.  The \nreality is that all of those appliances are coming down.  The \ntechnology is amazing.  People who are cooking on electricity are \nloving it.  And all of that will, in fact, be much more cheap and much \nmore reliable and much more efficient to use, so you won't need as \nmuch power to use those. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  So some of my colleagues \ntalked about the expense of power, and -- and I couldn't agree more.  I \nmean, during COVID we had people -- the New York State said, \nUtilities, you can't turn off their electric .\nMS. SIMON:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. GIGLIO:  If they can't afford to pay their bills \nyou can't turn off their electric.  And then years later, the utility \ncompanies went to the PSC and said, We're $8 billion in the hole for \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n146the people that didn't pay their utility bills because New York State \nsaid they didn't have to and we couldn't turn them off.  So we need to \nincrease the rates .  So now everyone's paying rates because we said \ndon't turn off their utility bills.  Are you familiar with that?  \nMS. SIMON:  Yes.  And the reality is even where, for \nexample, just so you're fully familiar, where somebody does have their \ngas turned off for nonpayment, those arrears are not borne by the \ncompany, those arrears are borne by you and I. \nAnd let me just correct an answer I gave you before.  \nLet me just correct an answer I gave you before where I said work it \nout with the utility.  In reality, if they've already applied for gas, they \nwouldn't -- this wouldn't be subject to this new law.\nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  So like if they already --\nMS. SIMON:  So that 100-foot rule connection would \nstill be free to that person who has already applied for that connection. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  So thank you very much for the \nanswers to the questions.  Just one more. \nSo, is New York State subsidizing conversion from \ngas or oil to electric, which could cost anywhere from 35,000 to \n50,000 per household?  We're incentivizing people to connect to -- \nwith electric, not with gas.  Are we -- they're coming from oil to \nelectric.  Are there any subsidies to make the conversion from oil to \nelectric?  \nMS. SIMON:  I believe they are.  Those have been \nprimarily through NYSERDA .  Some local governments do as well. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n147And that is the answer to that question. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  Thank you very much for the \nanswers to my questions. \nMS. SIMON:  You're welcome. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Madam Speaker, on the bill.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMS. GIGLIO:  So, restaurants are asked to come off \nthe grid during peak times when people are using their air \nconditioners, when people are doing -- you know, using a lot of \nelectric.  Restaurants are coming off the grid and using oil-powered \ngenerators to stay open and to keep the lights on and to keep the \ncooking going and to keep it all going.  So we are really so far behind \nthe times when it comes to a smooth transition.  And we are throwing \neverything into the sink all at once without taking into consideration a \nsmooth transition.  So it's -- it's -- we can't handle the switchover.  \nRight now, the grid cannot support a switchover.  If we said tomorrow \neverybody's got to go to electric for everything that they're doing and \nusing in their homes, in their businesses, the grid can't support it. \nYou know, my -- my colleague went through a list of \nthings that are subsidized and that are free in the State of New York.  \nYou know, she left off cable but I -- I thought I'd add that in.  But, you \nknow, we said low income residents in the State of New York should \nonly have to pay 6 percent of their income towards their utility bills.  \nThe ratepayers are picking up the rest of that utility bill.  Our electric \nrates are going higher and higher.  There is nothing about a smooth \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n148transition here.  We're talking about affordability here.  You know, not \nforcing neighbors to pay for someone to hook up to gas, but we're \ngonna force the neighbors to hook -- pay for somebody to hook up to \nelectric, which is just a preposterous statement to ask the neighbors to \npay for a hookup to electric but not for gas. \nAs New York becomes less affordable, fewer people \nwant to stay here.  They want to leave.  The utility rates are too high.  \nThere's seems to be no reprieve.  The middle-class has now become -- \nNew York State has become dependent on the middle-class because \nthe upper-class is saying, We can't do it anymore.  We can't foot the \nbill.  And people that I talk to in New York and in my district are tired \nof paying other people's bills.  But we're gonna pay for electric but not \nfor a gas choice.  And New York's -- New Yorkers' choices are being \ntaken away from them.  So with future -- fewer people here to \nsubsidize all of these initiatives that my colleague read off, and \nadditional ones that I left off the list and I'm sure she left off the list, \nwe are making New York less affordable.  Less affordable to live \nhere, less affordable to keep the lights on, and less affordable to work \nhere.\nSo for all those reasons I will be voting in the \nnegative.  I -- I agree we need a transition.  It should be a smooth \ntransition.  But New Yorkers should have choices.  And they shouldn't \nbe punished by taking away the 100 feet of a gas connection payout \nwhen gas is cleaner than oil and they can't afford a full electric \ntransition to go from oil to electric. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n149So for those reasons, again, I'll be voting in the \nnegative.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Fitzpatrick.  \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nJust on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  You know, in 2006, Al Gore \nreleased his fiction best-seller, An Inconvenient  Truth, and the \nenvironmental left, you know, drank the Kool-Aid and has been \nhallucinating ever since.  What started with global warming became \nclimate change, and now we have an existential climate crisis.  Look, \nonly socialists and Brooklyn hipsters would believe such nonsense.  \nWe are not in a crisis.  What we're doing here is trying to kill a very \nsuccessful, very reliable and a very dependent industry known as the \nfossil fuel natural gas industry.  We are trying to kill this industry with \n-- with death by a thousand cuts, and this bill is a perfect example of \nthat.  It's not, Oh, it's just about, you know, forcing the rate base to , \nyou know, pay for 100 feet.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've spent \nover $28 billion as a State, all of us as taxpayers, on the renewable \nindustry; an industry that couldn't stand on its own two feet if it had to \nsurvive on its own.  So we have to use the power of government to \ndistort the economics of the most reliable energy-producing industry \nwe have in this country to try and make this dream of all-electric \nwork. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n150So this bill, I think, should be defeated.  It probably \nwon't be, but we will continue to try to use the power of government \nto distort the economics of energy to meet this goal that we will never \nreach.  And in the meantime, we will destroy the jobs of thousands \nupon thousands of plumbers and other trades to reach this pipe dream \nthat I don't think we're ever going to reach. \nYou know, a wise young analyst who follows this \nissue once said that you can't force technology before it has matured.  \nThe all-electric industry is nowhere near maturity, and it can't do it on \nits own.  It needs government support, which means all of us as \ntaxpayers and ratepayers are going to have to foot the bill.  So here we \nare, complaining about 100 feet, which has been the custom, while 28 \nbillion and growing is being spent by all of us to prop up an industry \nthat can't support itself. \nMadam Speaker, this bill should die a quick and \nrapid death; unfortunately it won't here in the State of New York.  But \neverybody should vote no.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMs. Levenberg. \nMS. LEVENBERG:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. LEVENBERG:  I've heard a lot of things today.  \nI wanna to just prop up and thank the sponsor for putting forth a bill \nwhich, in fact, does just kind of nip around the edges.  It's the bare  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n151minimum.  It isn't actually getting at the big picture of what we really \nneed to do, which is the New York HEAT bill, and get -- getting rid of \nthe obligation to serve.  \nWhen I hear that these -- these other -- these other \nindustries are getting subsidies, the fossil fuel industry has been \nreceiving subsidies for years.  I still remember going out with my \npredecessor, Sandy Galef, to see what fracking really looked like out \nin Pennsylvania before -- before New York State decided not to allow \nfracking.  I am so grateful that we do not allow fracking in this State, \nbut it doesn't actually mean that we're not still reaping the negative \nbenefits.  However, what I saw with fracking was a destruction of \nland.  A destruction of water.  A destruction of clean air.  Overuse -- I \nsaw crime had risen.  I saw schools that were overburdened with trans \n-- transient workers who came in for short periods of time and then \nleft.  And, you know, rates that were going up and down.  It was \nhorrific, what was happening to the land where fracking was taking \nplace.  And that is something that's gonna continue to happen.  And \nthat is the same thing that's happening to all of our natural resources \nbecause of drilling for oil and continuing to try to rely on \nunsustainable fossil fuels.  This is just a start, because we are asking \npeople to stop relying on fossil fuels to heat their homes.  But it \ndoesn't increase the rates for people if they're wanting to transition, \nbecause they can transition to electricity.  And when they do transition \nto electricity, not only -- their rates will actually come down, I think \nthe average is $1,450 annually, by switching to a heat pump and then \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n152they might get also the benefit of having air conditioning as well.  So \nthis is a savings for people.  It's not an increase if they choose to \nconvert away from, for example, delivered fuels.  And yes, there are \nsubsidies because we are trying to move in the direction of more \nsustainability so we don't have the wildfires.  So we don't have the \nfloods.  These are all the results of our reliance on fossil fuels.  We \nneed to start somewhere.  All -- everybody's saying, Oh, we're not \nready yet.  But we're never ready to start.  This is yet another piece of \nthe puzzle that we need to do to start segueing off of fossil fuels. \nAgain, I'm so grateful to my -- to the sponsor for \nputting forth this bare minimum bill.  But it is a start, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Burdick. \nMR. BURDICK:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nthe opportunity to speak on this bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. BURDICK:  I want to thank the sponsor for \nbringing this bill forward and for her tenacity in pushing ahead with \nthis, and to thank the Speaker for allowing it to come to the floor.  \nAnd with all due respect to the assertions of the \nMinority, this bill is aimed to remove a burden from ratepayers; the \nburden of the 100-foot rule -- the 100-foot rule which very simply \nrequires utilities to connect residential gas lines to homes within 100 \nfeet of the -- of the main.  But who pays for that?  Who pays for that?  \nIt is disingenuous to suggest anything other than that all the other \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n153ratepayers need to pay for it because it's an operating expense of the \nutility, which they recover through rates.\nSo I enthusiastically support this bill and vote in the \naffirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS.

BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker for allowing me to explain my vote. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n154I first want to thank the sponsor for this great bill, and \nI want to thank All-Electric Building Act [sic].  This bill is mainly \nrelevant for our customers who might be converting from oil to \npropane as new construction is already required to be all-electric \nstarting in 2026 for buildings under seven stories.  Numerous  studies \nhave shown that customers who switch from oil or propane to \nall-electric heating and coding [sic]  -- use -- use heat pumps will save \nmoney; hundreds to thousands per year.  It does not make sense for all \nratepayers to subsidize the cost of adding more customers to the gas \nsystem when that system is already starting to create a cost crisis for \nthe ratepayers on it as they are facing a huge aging expensive gas \npipeline system within a shrinking customer base. \nThe -- the 100-rule [sic] policy forces New Yorkers \nto subsidize costly gas line extensions, costing ratepayers more than \n$200 million every year.  It preserves the subsidization of hookups \nwithin 100 for electricity or recognizes that subsidizing the expansion \nof gas system is not aligned with New York's long-term goals and is \ndangerous for long-term affordability and stability for utility \nratepayers.  Ending this subsidy would save all ratepayers money, \nimmediately benefitting customers and align utility subsidies with \nNew York's climate goals. \nAnd with this, Madam Speaker, I will be voting in the \naffirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Bichotte \nHermelyn in the affirmative. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n155Ms. Shrestha to explain her vote.\nMS. SHRESTHA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWhen our utility, Central Hudson, filed for a rate increase in 2023, the \ncost that was attached to customer-requested new connections was \n$44.3 million.  And the next year when they filed for a rate increase \nagain, the cost attached to that same expense was $29 million.  And \nthere are additional costs attached to this expansion that are just not \nthe initial one, such as the utility being able to charge authorized \nprofits on the new value of the asset, property taxes and interest that \nare paid on that new asset, as well as maintenance that needs to \nhappen on that asset, even though all of these assets are destined to be \nstranded.\nSo this is a welcomed though small step in being \nrealistic about how modern and efficient and up to the task our energy \nsystem needs to be, so I will be voting in the affirmative.\nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Shrestha in the \naffirmative. \nMs. Simon to explain her vote. \nMS. SIMON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  This bill \nends New York State's 100-foot rule, which would save hardworking \nNew Yorkers $200 million a year.  The bill does not prevent new gas \nhookups, it simply means that everyone else won't be forced to pay \n$200 million a year to hook up new customers and line the pockets of \nutility shareholders.  Currently, hooking up to gas is not free.  It's paid \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n156for by everyone else.  No one is taking your gas away.  The \ninconvenient truth is, in fact, the truth, however inconvenient.  This \nwill simply incentivize hookups to electric and heat pumps, which are \nmore reliable, less expensive and better for our health and the \nenvironment.  In fact, if you look at National Grid's website, they \nencourage you not to get connected to gas.  For example, heat pumps \nare estimated to save people in a single-family home $900 a year \ncompared to new homes on gas.  It will also help New York State \nmeet our current All-Electric Construction Act [sic] and our climate \ngoals. \nWe're asking the subsidized -- we're subsidizing the \nfossil fuel infrastructure through rate hikes that -- that reflect all of us.  \nMany of the arguments that have been made mix apples and oranges, \nand all we get when we do that is fruit salad. \nI want to thank the Speaker and our staff who have -- \nwhose dedication is unmatched.  I am thankful to the incredible \nadvocates and the people of New York State who have been \nclamoring for more affordability.  We have much more work to do, \nincluding many of the things people have talked about such as \neliminating the obligation to serve gas and replacing it with the \nobligation to serve energy.  But this is a huge step in the right \ndirection in affordability and a healthier New York. \nThank you.  I'll be voting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Simon in the \naffirmative. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n157Ms. Kelles to explain her vote. \nMS. KELLES:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I just \nwanted to -- to note how to me how profoundly disingenuous it is to \nsay that we want affordability and spend years blocking subsidizing \nrenewable energy infrastructure and then say we have to go back to \nnatural gas because natural gas is cheaper.  Oh, my goodness, what a \nlie.  And I'm watching the lobbyists outside give each other high fives, \nand it's astounding to me.  We have a plan to go -- to move to \nrenewable.  We know that it would ultimately be cheaper.  But I see \nover and over and over again, blocking, blocking, blocking, blocking \nevery single one of those efforts and then saying, See, because we've \nblocked all those efforts and because natural gas is subsidized , \nnatural gas is therefore cheaper, therefore the only thing to do for \npeople to have -- to have affordable energy is to do natural gas.  And \nthen to focus on the fact that renewable energy infrastructure, Well, we \nhave slave labor.  We have -- what are we gonna do with the parts \nwhen we have to re place them, when natural gas infrastructure and the \nindustry has produced more slave labor and more child labor than any \nindustry in the history of the -- of humanity.  So I just find that all \nprofoundly disingenuous.  This bill is exclusively saying we are going \nto create an equal playing field so natural gas is not subsidized.  We're \nmoving in the right direction.  Yes, it's smaller than the bill we wanted \nbecause well, because there was tremendous lobbying efforts to cut it \ndown to size.  But this is the move in the right direction for the \nenvironmental agenda that we have, which we know once that  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n158infrastructure is in place because we invest in it, will actually be \nprofoundly cheap in comparison to the system that we have. \nSo I want to thank the sponsor for moving this \nforward.  It is a step in the right direction.  It's not big enough.  We \nwill get there.  Thank you so much for all of your work.  This is for \naffordability, and this is for sustainability.  Both happen together and \nwill because of these efforts. \nThank you so much, and I stand in support of this \nlegislation. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Kelles in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Ari Brown to explain his vote. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I \nheard about fruit salad and disingenuous things.  You know, I counted, \nI had to stop at 33 times of how it's not fair that other people should \npay other people's bills, we shouldn't be subsidizing lower-income \npeople if they wanted to have gas service.  And I asked myself, what \nabout the $7.2 billion that the State spent on illegal immigrants?  That \nsubsidy's okay, but the $200 million to help lower-income \nneighborhoods, that's no longer okay?  That's the reason why I will \nalways vote in the negative on this bill.  \nThank you.\nMS. CRUZ:  We shouldn't be saying the word \"illegal \nimmigrant\" on this floor.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Cruz --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n159MS. CRUZ:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk) it's illegal.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Please state your \npoint of order. \nMS. CRUZ:  The words \"illegal immigrant\" are \nderogatory.  They're personally hurtful and they should not be uttered \non this floor. \nMS. WALSH:  The speaker has finished speaking, \nthen, Madam Speaker.  He's finished speaking. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  Mr. Ari \nBrown in the negative.\nMr. Gandolfo to explain his vote. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nFirst, I'm not exactly sure what initiatives the member is referring to \nthat we have blocked over here.  Our party has not held power in this \nChamber since about 25 years before I was born.  So I don't know \nwhat exactly what we did to prevent this energy agenda from moving \nforward.  That said, we heard repeatedly that this bill was simply \nabout saving ratepayer money and stopping the subsidies for that \n100-foot hookup.  But then once we called the vote it turns out that \nthis is part of a larger green energy agenda.  But what it's actually \ndoing is going to disincentivize people who are on old heating oil \nsystems from converting to cleaner natural gas systems, which in \nmany cases are -- only omit about half the CO2 as heating oil does.  \nSo it's kind of missing the forest for the trees here.  I think we could \nhave done better during this transitionary period as we move to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n160greener energy.  And again, I think we're rushing this.  Natural gas is a \nvery good transitional energy as we continue to move towards cleaner- \nburning fuels.  And once again we're just kind of jumping the shark \nwith this. \nSo I will be voting no and I encourage my colleagues \nto do the same. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gandolfo in the \nnegative. \nMr. Bologna to explain his vote. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I \njust want to address the -- the disingenuous here.  When we talk about \naffordability in the grand scope of this universal electrification push, \nthe people that it actually is going to impact most are those on \nunderserved or disenfranchised or low socioeconomic communities.  \nA lot of these houses and residential places that these -- that people \nlive are older homes that are gonna have to have conversions in their \nhomes to accommodate this new electric grid.  It is -- on average, it \nwould cost these people in these -- in these homes $8- to $10,000 to \nmaybe redo their electric from knob and tube, putting in a -- a new \nelectrical box in their house with a 220 line for -- you know, whether \nit's their electric cars or whatever it is, their new stove.  So, again, this \nis something that is gonna fall on these people.  So, again, when we're \ntalking about affordability, I really want to hone in on -- on who it is \nwe're trying to help here.  Because, again, the -- the -- you know, \npeople in suburban and in, you know, upper-class communities, this is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n161not gonna really impact them because the cost is not gonna be \nprohibitive.  It is the people in lower economic areas that they're \ngonna have to be the ones to pay for all the conversions of their old \nhomes to meet the new standards of the CLCPA.  And I understand \nthat's off the point of this particular piece of legislation, but it's a \ngreater message of who are we actually trying to help?  \nSo I just wanted to get that point, and I will be in the \nnegative on this legislation. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Bologna in the \nnegative. \nMr. Palmesano to explain his vote. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes, Madam Speaker, my \ncolleagues.  If we want to be -- not be disingenuous, let's be honest \nwith the ratepayers.  The sponsor said this is gonna save $200 million.  \nThe Climate Action Council plan, the CLCPA, the lower estimates are \na quarter-of-a-trillion dollars.  So we're okay with ratepayers \nsubsidizing that.  My colleague talked about bills that would subsidize \nratepayers paying for landscaping equipment.  They're okay for \nratepayers paying for used cars, electric cars.  You're okay for \nratepayers paying for heat pumps.  You're okay with that, but yet -- \nand they want -- I -- I see -- I love the outrage against our utility \ncompanies, but it's your policies that are driving up the rates.  When \nare you gonna realize that and be -- stop being disingenuous with the \nratepayers about that?  The whole -- electricity residential rate in 2019 \nwas 17 cents per kilowatt hour.  This year it's 26 cents per kilowatt \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n162hour.  That's 40 percent higher than the national average.  Similar for \ncommercial.  It's your policies that are driving it up.  Let's be realistic.  \nLet's be honest with the ratepayers instead of being disingenuous.  \nAnd by the way, I know this is for climate change.  Again, New York \nonly contributes 0.4 percent of total global emissions.  China is 30 \npercent, has 1,000 coal plants and building more every week.  I don't \nthink China is gonna help us.  And if we add India and Russia, that's \n40 percent of -- of using coal emissions.  So let's be honest and that's \nbeing -- that's -- that's being honest with the ratepayers.  That's what \nwe should be doing.\nSo I vote no because this all about dismantling the \naffordable and reliable natural gas infrastructure, and it's all designed \nto take away consumer choice on how you heat your home, cook your \nfoot, power your building and the vehicle you drive.  It will jeopardize  \nthe reliability of the grid, leading to dangerous blackouts, and it will \ncontinue our nation-leading outmigration or more businesses, families, \nsmall businesses, manufacturers leaving the State of New York. \nI vote no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Palmesano in \nthe negative. \nAre there any other votes?

A simple miscommunication because his father and his father's \nfriend was all it took for Rees' little life to end.  My son Daniel, now \nolder than Rees, has been taking swimming lessons since he was six \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n169months old at a program specifically for babies called AquaBeba due \nto the risk of child drownings.  \nWhat this bill does is require school districts to give \nparents and guardians information on drowning prevention, water \nsafety and healthy swimming at the beginning of the school year.  \nDrowning incidents involving young children can significantly \nreduce -- be reduced with proper education, tools beyond swimming \nlessons.  Rees' father expressed that had he been provided with even a \nminimal amount of information on drowning prevention, he believe \nhis son would still be alive today.  This underscores the critical need \nfor awareness campaigns, accessible resources and community-driven \ninitiatives to educate parents and caregivers about water safety.  \nSimple measures such as teaching children to do -- to float, installing \npool barriers and understanding the signs of drowning can make a \nprofound difference in saving lives.

This \nbill amends the -- repeals a requirement that businesses must be \nunwritten and transacted from an office within the State of New York \nin order to be eligible for placement in the free trade zone.  The free \ntrade zone is a useful tool for insurers that provide some flexibility \nfrom the usual rate and form filing process as it relates to larger, \nsophisticated or highly-specialized risk.  Unfortunately, the free trade \nzone fails to be utilized to its fullest potential, because current law \nrequires that in order to be eligible to place a risk in the free trade \nzone, the businesses must be underwritten and transacted from an \noffice within New York State.  By striking this requirement, this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n172legislation will encourage competition between admitted market \ninsurers and protect policyholders from incentivizing the placement of \ncomplex risk in the free trade zone, keeping these policies under the \nregulatory oversight of the Department of Financial Services.\nI urge a yes vote.

RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I want to \nthank the sponsor for her partnership on this piece of legislation, the \nSpeaker, Chair Pretlow and certainly my leader, Leader Barclay, for \ntheir help in getting this bill to the floor.  \nWhat this legislation does is it allows individuals \napplying for or renewing a driver's license or nondriver ID to opt in to \nreceive information from the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplant [sic] \nProgram and the National Marrow Donor Program; both of which \nconnect volunteer donors to patients in need of a bone marrow \ntransplant.\nIn the U.S. every three minutes someone is diagnosed \nwith a blood -- blood cancer like leukemia, lymphoma or melanoma -- \nmyeloma.  About 70 percent of those patients who need a transplant \nwon't have a fully matched donor in their family, and according to the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n176latest data more than 1.6 million Americans are currently living with \nor in remission from blood cancers and more than 57,000 were \nexpected to die from them in 2024 alone.  Transplants are often the \nonly viable transplant, especially for those with aggressive or late- \nstaged diseases.\nMy mother was one of those patients.  In her \ntwenties, she was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  They \ntold her she'd never have children.  She made a recovery through her \ntreatment.  She had triplets.  I'm one of them.  When I was in high \nschool, her cancer came back and she had to have a bone marrow \ntransplant ultimately.  It was that donor and that bone marrow \ntransplant that allowed her to see me graduate high school and \ngraduate college.  This bill, simply put, will help more families have \nthe experience I had of having my mother around for those extra \nyears.  We lost her in January of 2007, but her perseverance through \nher illness is something that I carry with me each and every day.  \nSo, I can't thank all of colleagues enough who have \nsponsored this legislation; again, the sponsor and all of my colleagues \nwho are voting in the affirmative and I'm not sure I've ever been \nhappier to say I cast my vote in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Ra in the \naffirmative. \n(Applause) \nAre there any other votes?

MCMAHON:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n213explain my vote. \nThis legislation addresses a serious problem in the \nFamily Court Act where there's a finding or admission of abuse or \nneglect of a child by a person who is a member of the household but is \nnot a parent of that child.  In those cases, the court is currently limited \nto imposing a one-year Order of Protection.  In contrast, where the \nabuser is a parent, the court can impose a two-year order, extend it to \nfive years under specific aggravating circumstances.   \nI firmly believe that one of the most important things \nwe can do as a legislative Body is to protect the most vulnerable \namong us.  With this legislation, we make these two statutes \nconsistent and give the family court judges the tools they need to \nbetter protect those children who have been subjected to horrific abuse \nor neglect by a non-parent.\nI want to thank my colleagues for your support of this \nbill, and my friend, retired Family Court Judge Lisa Rodwin, for her \nunwavering advocacy for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I vote in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER TAYLOR:  Ms. McMahon in \nthe affirmative.\nMs. Walsh to explain her vote. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I join in \nsupporting this piece of legislation.  I think it is really important.  \nWhen you have other people who are unrelated to the child in the \nhousehold, it's always really tricky because you try to look at whether \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n214you can define that person as a PLR, or a person legally responsible.  \nSo if you've got somebody that's not related that has really stepped \ninto, like, almost a parental role, then they would considered a parent \nfor the purposes of an Order of Protection.  But if maybe it's a brand- \nnew boyfriend or a roommate or something like that, it's just -- it's \nkind of like no man's land.  And if that person ends up causing harm \nto the child, it was a big problem with Orders of Protection.\nSo this is really important.  This is -- I'm really glad \nthat this is getting brought forward and I'm really happy to support it \nagain this year.  Hopefully it'll get really way across the finish line this \nyear.\nSo, thanks a lot.  In the affirmative, please. \nACTING SPEAKER TAYLOR:  Ms. Walsh in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

An act to amend the Real Property Tax Law, in relation to the \nassessment of solar or wind energy systems.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by \nMr. Lasher, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced. \nAn explanation had been requested.\nMr. Lasher.\nMR. LASHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  This \nbill is a technical piece of legislation to address a court challenge to a \nprevious act of the Legislature.  In 2020, this Legislature enacted Real \nProperty Tax Law 575(b), which requires municipalities to adopt a \nunform appraisal methodology for wind and solar energy systems and \nauthorized the Department of Tax and Finance to establish such a \nmethodology.  \nEarly this year, the Supreme Court in the County of \nAlbany struck down that law as delegating in excess of authority to \nDepartment of Tax and Finance.  This legislation would incorporate \nthe necessary guidance and parameters into the statute, so as to \naddress the delegation issue and to allow the previously established \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n225will of the Legislature to be effectuated.\nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Bailey. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Will the sponsor yield for some \nquestions?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. LASHER:  Certainly.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker and \nthank you to the sponsor.  Real quick, the changes that we're making \nto this piece of legislation is indicating that it's going to be mandatory \nthat we use the -- the discounted cash flow model when we're looking \nat the assessments for these projects coming out.  We have added in \nthere, you know, what is going to constitute the expense, what's \nconsidered revenues.  So, I guess I would like to just ask a couple of \nquestions in and around that.  How did we come up with the -- the \npieces, you know; specifically, host community benefit payments?  \nAnd then we're gonna look at the decommissioning -- the expense for \ndecommissioning and then the community solar subscriber.\nSo, specifically, the host community benefit \npayments, how was that -- how did we come about adding that in as \nan expense?  \nMR. LASHER:  Thank you.  In a previous -- in the -- \nin the earlier act of the Legislature, this Body gave broad authority to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n226DTF to establish the methodology and this Legislation merely puts \ninto statute aspects of the methodology that they established under our \nauthorization; again, all of which is simply to deal with the delegation \nissue identified by the court. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And how did we come up \nwith using host community payments as a cost?  \nMR. LASHER:  Again, just to be clear, we -- I, as the \nsponsor of the legislation, did not come up with any of this.  It reflects \nthe judgment  and findings of the Department of Tax and Finance \nunder the authorization previously given to them by this Legislature. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And if I'm not mistaken in, \nas you indicated, the decision that came out of the Supreme Court in \nAlbany County was that the very broad brush that we used in the \nlegislation previously, we needed to indicate what would be \nconstituted as expenses and what would be constituted as revenues; \nam I correct?\nMR. LASHER:  In -- in the court decision, the judge \nwrote that the court is guided by the principles laid out by the Court of \nAppeals in Dean v. Whalen , the Legislature may constitutionally \nconfer discretion upon an administrative agency, only if it limits the \nfield in which that discretion is to operate and provides standards to \ngovern this exercise.  And with that in mind, this legislation aims to \ndo that. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So, this legislation -- we are \nlooking at host communities -- the host community agreements as a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n227cost?  Or is at an expense, correct?  \nMR. LASHER:  The court further -- further \ndetermined that the Legislature failed to enact reasonable safeguards \nand standards in directing the assessment of solar and wind energy \nsystems using the discounted cash flow approach.  So, again, we are \ntrying to inshrine in the statute those safeguards and parameters that \nDTF arrived at under the authorization we gave them previously.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And the reason I specifically \nask about that is, you know, under -- this was open for public \ncomment and based off of that public comment, I -- I just want to read \nsomething and then maybe ask my question again.  \n(Reading) There was a small host community \nagreement expense embedded in the operating expenses in the 2022 \nmodel -- and this is referring to the 2024 model -- while attempting to \nupdate the data for the 2024 model, the department determined that \nthere was not sufficient support for that expense.  The department \ndoes not currently have sufficient evidence to justify including an \nHCA expense of $3 per kilowatt, or any other amount.  The HCA \nexpense has therefore removed from the model.  Further -- \nfurthermore, it would be difficult for assessors to verify such an \nexpense. \nSo my question, again, is, how did we come up with \nadding that in here if the responses back from the comments on -- on \nthe department's website is indicating something a little different?  \nMR. LASHER:  The DTF made some revisions, I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n228believe, to the model, including with regard to the treatment of tax \ncredits following the public comment and this legislation reflects the \nfinal determination of the Department of Tax and Finance. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  As far as decommissioning \nexpenses, when do decommissioning expenses occur?  \nMR. LASHER:  As I said, this Legislature reflects the \nfinal determination of the Department of Tax and Finance. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So when we're looking at a \ndecommissioning expense, we are -- we are taking that into account at \nthe time of assessment for these projects -- and if I'm not mistaken, the \njudge -- or the justification  for doing this legislation... (Reading) Its \nurgent transition to clean energy and meeting ambitious renewable \nenergy goals are crucial steps in combatting climate change.  The \nscale and severity of which is widely known, the deep -- and deeply \nfelt, where in New York State incentivizing and encouraging the \nexpenses of wind and solar projects is an important part of the \nsolution.  Yet, the financial viability of these projects is tenacious \nbased on the unreliable appraisal model currently employed in New \nYork.  And then it goes on to say, (Reading) This uncertainty \ndisincentivizes investments in the solar and wind sector, delaying \ncritically-needed projects that will help New York transition to \nrenewable energy sources.  The implementation of the reliable \nappraise model will fill in these gaps and further New York's process \nto it.  And part of the concern is that at the time that these -- these \npotential developers or these developments are coming into an area, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n229the unpredictability from any one local municipality where the \nassessors may be involved in that, is leading to having this mandated \nformula.  So, if we're worry -- if we're looking at them coming in, how \ndid we take the decommissioning, which comes at the end of the \nproject, which we can't anticipate what that expense is going to be at \nthis time, how are we able to utilize that as an expense in the model \nupon inception?  \nMR. LASHER:  Look, I think as a practical matter, \nthe questions that you're raising were resolved and addressed by this \nLegislature in 2020, and this Legislature made a judgment  that a \nuniform tax appraisal methodology served the public interest.  And \nthere was a narrow technical deficiency in that legislation, which was \nan excess of delegation to the Department of Tax and Finance.  This \nlegislation aims merely to address that narrow technical deficiency. \nMRS. BAILEY:  In 2020, when -- when the initial \nbill was brought forward, how -- how did that come to the floor?  \nMR. LASHER:  I -- I -- it was duly enacted by this \nBody. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Through the budget?  \nMR. LASHER:  It was duly enacted by this Body. \nMRS. BAILEY:  I believe it was policy that was \nwritten into the budget in 2021, which had a legal battle in 2022, went \nback to the budget in '23 and here we are in '25 on the floor. \nMR. LASHER:  One -- one might -- \n(Cross-talk)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n230MRS. BAILEY:  (Indiscernible) -- \n(Cross-talk)\nMR. LASHER:  -- one might say -- one might say \nthat the Legislature has acted affirmatively on this issue twice. \nMRS. BAILEY:  We can agree to disagree.  As far as \nthe decommissioning expenses, I'm gonna go back to that.  It indicates \nhere the decommissioning expenses are included, all they -- although \nthey are at the end-of-life expense, with changes in technology panels \nwill last longer for solar rays and more easily cheaply replaced, this \nmay result in an indefinite life of a solar -- solar arrays, in particular.  \nDecommissioning should not be an expense.  The response to that \nwas, (Reading) The draft models decommissioning costs were \ncalculated based on samples of projects provided by NYSERDA .  The \ndepartment's understanding of the issue is that decommissioning costs \nare an appropriate expense for the majority of products -- or projects.  \nThe department has not presented with -- has not been presented with \nsufficient data to adjust that.  So, I guess my question would be, if we \nare -- if we are bringing this into what the law is going to read moving \nforward, what constitutes -- you know, what was the sample projects \nthat came forward and what are the majority of these projects that \nwere -- that were looked at?  \nMR. LASHER:  Again, this legislation merely \nfollows the guidance of the Department of Tax and Finance through \ntheir process. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So, then I'm going to go on \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n231to community solar subscriber management costs.  We're using that as \nan expense as well, correct?  \nMR. LASHER:  Again, the -- I am going to say, quite \nsimply, that this reflects the determinations made by the tax -- \nDepartment of Tax and Finance and merely aims to establish the \nparameters to address the deligation issue that the trial court in Albany \nidentified. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  But we as legislators have \nthe opportunity to make sure that the direction that we're giving in \nthis -- in this piece of legislation are accurate and will benefit all New \nYorkers; am I correct in that?\nMR. LASHER:  I would suggest that the Legislature \ndetermines the public interest was served by granting a wide berth to \nthe Department of Tax and Finance; ultimately determined by the \ncourt to be slightly too wide.  And so, we are addressing that with this \nbill. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  I do want to go back to the -- \nto the community solar subscriber management cost.  So, when that \nwas raised in the 2024 model, it -- and it was argued that it should \ninclude this expense, the response was, the department did not receive \nsufficient data regarding subscriber acquisitions, management or \nreacquisition cost to justify inserting those expenses in the model.  \nAnd here we are, inserting it into the model.  Although, the three, you \nknow, it's specifically indicating that it possibly should not be; is that \ncorrect?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n232MR. LASHER:  The legislation reflects the \ndeterminations of the Department of Tax and Finance. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So, we continue to refer \nback to the Department of Tax and Finance.  I believe under Section \nC and just so I understand this correct, when it was brought forward in \n'21 through the budget, then '23, the formulation of the model and \ndiscount rate in New York State Department of Taxation and Finance \nshall consult with New York State Assessors Association; is that \naccurate?  \nMR. LASHER:  Yes. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  Provide further and the \nformulazation [sic] of a such a model, you know, through the \ndepartment.  So, have we taken into account any feedback from the \nAssessors Association?  \nMR. LASHER:  I believe that there was -- the \nDepartment of Tax and Finance adhered to the law and did indeed \nconsult with the New York State Assessors Association. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  Do you know if there have \nbeen any studies done or if we have looked at any projects as to, you \nknow, based on the project, if there is currently a pilot in place, if we \nwere to utilize this formal as it's outlined, what that might look like for \nany one project?  \nMR. LASHER:  Sorry.  Could you repeat the \nquestion?  \nMRS. BAILEY:  So, when we're -- when we're \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n233looking at this formulation; so, have we looked at what any one \nmunicipality, schools, local -- local towns or villages, what their tax \nbase might -- or what their taxes, revenue coming in may switch based \non this formulation?  \nMR. LASHER:  I think if you -- I'll point you in the \ndirection of the affirmation of John Williams from the trial court case, \nwho notes that with even -- with such complexity and variability, even \nsmall changes in cost have a significant on -- affect -- impact on \nproject economics and observes the wide variability of the way that \nlocalities may go about these appraisals.  And so, I don't know and I \ndon't think that there is one prototypical locality that you could point \nto.  I think the whole idea behind the Legislature's action on this in \n2020 and again, was to create a standardized methodology, because \nyou could have wild variation. \nMRS. BAILEY:  So, I believe in that law -- in the, \nyou know, the court proceeding that you brought forward, I think there \nwas a dollar amount that has come out, correct?  That -- that that \ntown -- \nMR. LASHER:  Pertain -- \nMRS. BAILEY:  -- that taxing agency -- \nMR. LASHER:  -- again, pertaining to one locality.  \nAnd I would say, again, that you will find significant variation, \nlocality to locality, significant variation in the methodology of the \nappraisal, significant variation in the amount that results.  And that is \nthe purpose of this legislation; to create a level playing field, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n234something consistent across the State.  It is something that we have \ndone in other context and it's something other states have done as \nwell.  That's why the Legislature took action in 2020.  But, again, I \njust want to stress, these substantive questions were resolved through \nthe Legislature's action in 2020.  And what this bill aims to do is \nsimply resolve the issue of -- I should note, by the way, the law was \nchallenged -- there were five -- five cause [sic] of action in the \nlawsuit, the Airey case.  And the only one that succeeded was the issue \nof delegation and that is what this bill aims to address.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Correct.  And -- and you're referring \nto the case that is currently under appeal, correct?  \nMR. LASHER:  Correct. \nMRS. BAILEY:  All right.  So, in the formula -- and I \nknow you indicated that we are just identifying based off of that court \nruling, you know, what's in there.  You had indicated that the \nAssessors Association in -- in the language of the bill is to be referred \nto.  Have you spoken to the Assessors Association since this bill came \nforward on the 15th of May?  \nMR. LASHER:  I -- I have not personally -- \nMRS. BAILEY:  Or the 13th? \nMR. LASHER:  -- I have not personally spoke with \nthe Assessors Association.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  I did speak with the \nAssessors Association and they put a memorandum out based on the \n2024 model and they still stand by that. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n235MR. LASHER:  That is -- I -- \nMRS. BAILEY:  What -- \nMR. LASHER:  -- I -- my family consults with me on \nmany matters.  It doesn't mean they always listen to me.\nMRS. BAILEY:  I understand.  All right.  \nMadam Speaker, on the bill.  I thank the sponsor.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMRS. BAILEY:  So this is a good example of why \nputting policy in the budget is not a good idea.  Policy should take the \nproper legislative steps -- or the legislative paths.  This bill here, \nbefore us today, that's the step that it's coming, but this piece of -- this \nsection of law has been topic in two different lawsuits that come into \nquestion what it is that we're doing here.  \nSpecifically, I mention the Assessors Association.  \nAnd I -- I just have -- I want to just say a couple of things.  From that \nmemorandum from the -- from the New York State Assessors \nAssociation, these are the individuals who are in our local \nmunicipalities who understand what the taxing burden is in these \nmunicipalities and what is best for our local towns and villages.  \nWhen we're looking at a broad brush state-mandated formula, New \nYork State will be the only state that mandates such a calculation for \nwind and solar projects.  And arguably, I'm going to say it has a \nnegative impact on our local municipalities.  These projects are \nhappening left and right in my backyard.  I'm in contact with our \nassessors, I'm in contact with the developers and I'm in contact with \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n236the local municipalities on a whole as to what that means from their \ntaxing perspective.  In this memorandum, it indicates, (Reading) \nFurther, the New York State's Department of Tax and Finance \nprovides the model and discount rates based on documentation \nprovided by individual developers.  However, the local assessing unit \n[sic] often are not provided the documentation the State will use to \ndetermine the model in discount rates.  This puts local assessing units \nin a different place and unable to confirm the data and discount rates \nthat are receiving -- they are receiving from the State.  Further, there is \nno process to verify the accuracy of the data to -- so received.  New \nYork State Department of Taxation and Finance is asking assessors \nwith no verification or ability to confirm or validate and blindly accept \ninformation from each solar and wind developer and likely will be \nself-serving to ensure lower assessments.  For the model to work, \nthere needs to be mandatory reporting to the New York State \nDepartment of Tax and Finance and local municipalities, as well as a \nmechanism to enforce disclosure against any developer that is \nproviding faulty information or no information at all. \nIt goes on further to state that, (Reading) Under the \nstatute calling for solar and wind model, New York State Association \nof Assessors was mandated to be part of the process.  So, therefore, \nthey would like to provide this memorandum.  Although their position \nis that this mandate violates the assessor's constitutional duty to value \nour property in their municipalities, the New York State Association \nof Assessors strongly urges the New York State Department of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n237Taxation and Finance and NYSERDA  to review a schedule that they \nhave provided.  And that schedule outlines the proper method for \ncalculating a weighted average of cost of capital.  The renewable \nenergy goals of the State can be met through further discussion, \ninformation sharing and guidance from expert appraisers.  Let's not \ncreate a model that favors the industry at the expense of the average \nNew York State taxpayer, but rather work together to creat -- to creat \nmethodology that relates to a more accurate value for solar and wind \nprojects.  And that is exactly what we have here.  We have a \nmethodology that is going to favor the development coming in of the \nsolar and wind.  \nIt was stated earlier when we were discussing a bill, \nthat you and I are paying for their property taxes as well when it was \ndiscussed about utilities.  This here is just an exclamation point at the \nend of that statement.  It is our local municipalities who are the ones \nwho are going to lose out.  It's our schools.  It's our local fire \ndepartments.  It's our local EMS that rely on this tax base.  Three \nmillion dollars was the dollar amount that was mentioned in the \nlawsuit that's coming out of Albany County that is currently in the \nAppellate Court.  There have been estimates on some -- on some \nprojects that could be in the tens of thousands of dollars on an annual \nbasis.  Upwards for the State, it's going to be in the millions, tens of \nmillions of dollars of potentially lost tax revenue to our local \nmunicipalities.  And at the end of the day, it is our school [sic] and our \nresidents who are going to lose from this.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n238Therefore, Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time.  I \nwill be voting no on this piece of legislation.  And I would encourage \nall of my colleagues to really stop and look at how this is going to \nimpact your local municipality and I urge you to vote no as well.  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Tague.\nMR. TAGUE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for some questions, please?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. LASHER:  Certainly, Mr. Tague.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.  \nMR. TAGUE:  Thank you, Mr. Lasher.  I appreciate \nit.  First of all, first question:  Do you have any solar farms in your \ndistrict?  \nMR. LASHER:  We -- I -- not solar farms.  No. \nMR. TAGUE:  Okay.  Well, I do and I think there are \na lot of rural -- other rural members in this Body that have them as \nwell.  Do you know how many acres of productive, good farmland has \nbeen used up for projects like this?\nMR. LASHER:  You know, we were discussing it the \nother day.  I don't remember the exact number.  But I -- I -- \nMR. TAGUE:  About a half-million.  \nMR. LASHER:  -- but I know it's significant.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n239MR. TAGUE:  Half a million acres of productive \nfarmland.  I can't -- nothing else can be done on this farmland.  Every \nsingle time we go to do projects like this, where does it come?  Rural \nUpstate New York.  Rural Upstate New York.  Without asking us if \nit's something that we want, without allowing our local governments \nor our local people to have a say in the action.  People from New York \nCity and in the Governor's Office and NYSERDA  just decided that \nthey were going to site these projects in the place -- in the breadbasket \nof not only New York State, but of our country where our food is \ngrown.  \nAnd I would say to you, Mr. Lasher, I dare say that \nneither you and I could live without food; am I correct?  \nMR. LASHER:  Certainly.\nMR. TAGUE:  So the court has invalidated the \nunderlying laws unconstitutional delegation of taxing authority, an \nencroachment on the traditional authority of local assessing units, a \ndecision that as we have just talked about, has been appealed.  So, let \nme ask you this.  \n(Cross-talk)\nMR. LASHER:  Can I just -- \nMR. TAGUE:  -- why are we taking this bill up \nbefore the legal process reaches a conclusion?  \nMR. LASHER:  Mr. Tague, I -- I do have to, if I, \nrespectfully, may just point out that the -- the court -- the court's \ndecision hinged entirely on the issue of delegation to the Department \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n240of Tax and Finance, not on the issue of encroachment on the local \nassessors. \nMR. TAGUE:  All right.  Well, let me ask you this, \nthen.  And I will let you know, Mr. Lasher, Mr. Airey is actually a \nvery close, personal friend of mine.  He comes from my home county.  \nHe's a town supervisor in -- in one of the towns.  So, does this bill \nundermine the Airey v. State of New York ruling by, once again, \nallowing the State to prescribe a specific valuation model without \nsufficient legislative guidance?\nMR. LASHER:  I -- I don't think it -- it undermines \nthe trial court's decision.  I think it addresses the technical issue \nidentified by the trial court, which is a delegation to -- which is a -- an \nexcess of delegation to DTF.  And by including in the statute more \nspecificity about how to deal with expenses and revenue, it addresses \nthe delegation issue.  I don't think it undermines or is in any way a \ncross purpose with the court's decision.  It simply addresses the issue \nthe court found -- a flaw that the court found with the law.\nMR. TAGUE:  Let me ask you this, too.  And you \nand I come from way two different parts of the -- of the world, \nso-to-speak, in the same State.  But do you understand how much it \ncosts to run a volunteer fire company or a volunteer EMS or a town, \nvillage or county highway department within a very rural area where \nsome of these -- some of these highway departments are covering 25, \n30 miles in some of the roughest terrain possible?  Do you know how \nmuch it costs in our small local governments -- and I'll -- I'll give you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n241a perfect example.  In Schoharie County there's 30,000 people.  \nThere's probably 30,000 people that live on the block where you live. \nMR. LASHER:  I think, Mr. Tague, I -- I would say I \napproach this conversation with an enormous amount of humility as to \nthe policy issues that you and I were discussing the other day with \nregard to the balance between ensuring the viability of our agricultural \nsector, the revenue challenges associated with the loss of it, the \neconomic challenges, and the need to promote renewable energy.  \nThese are tough policy questions.  I will say, however, that this bill is \nnot a -- an energy policy bill.  It is certainly not an agricultural policy \nbill.  It is a technical fix on a -- on a Real Estate [sic] Property Tax \nLaw that was passed five years ago. \nMR. TAGUE:  But wouldn't you admit to me here \namongst all our colleagues that this piece of legislation, and along \nwith every other piece of legislation that fits in with this actual \nprogram is detrimental to the people of rural Upstate New York?  And \nlet me just -- and let me just follow up by saying what's even more of \na concern is we're putting these projects up everywhere, and of course \nthey want to put them where the best productive growing fields that \nwe have in rural Upstate New York.  And do you know what the \nkicker is?  Not one single person in any of those communities are \nbenefitting from these projects.  That -- that, sir, is the shame of this \nwhole thing.  The shame. \nMR. LASHER:  I would say, Mr. Tague, that I think \nyou are perhaps not giving due to the economic flexibility that it \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n242affords to the property owners.  But I say that with some, again, \nhumility and would just observe that this bill is a -- again, is a \ntechnical fix to an issue of -- of delegation, which is a constitutional \nissue and doesn't really get at these policy questions that, again, I -- \nI'm learning from you and I hope to continue to do so.  But that's not \nreally at issue in this bill. \nMR. TAGUE:  Well, I -- I appreciate that and I \nrespect -- I respect the opportunity that you and I had to talk the other \nday, and I respect you and -- and I appreciate the discussion we're \nhaving.  But when you come from a hometown like I do, a place that \nat one time was full of dairy farms and crop fields and they're turning \ninto nothing but solar arrays.  And one thing that you mentioned that's \na problem, yeah, the property owners are benefitting but guess what?  \nNone of the property owners are the original property owners because \npeople from the City and other states figured out what was going on, \ncame into the community and bought up the property and they're the \nones that are benefitting.  But the people that live next to it that just \nbuilt a brand-new house ten years ago or five years ago, they're not \nbenefitting.  Their taxes are now actually gonna get raised because \nwe're giving these other folks a break.  Okay?  And when they bought \ntheir house or built their house, they never thought that there was \ngonna be a solar farm around it.  They don't have a problem with the \nfarmer going out there with his Haybine and cutting 50 acres of hay or \ngoing out there with a combine and cutting 50 acres of corn.  But what \nthey have a problem with is with these solar farms, and they're not \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n243getting one darn benefit.  Not one darn benefit. \nOn the bill, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. TAGUE:  You know, I stood here when the \noriginal bill-in-chief on this whole program was passed.  I debated my \n-- my good colleague from Long Island; it was a budget bill.  The \nGovernor of the State of New York at the time and NYSERDA  \npushed this bill through in the middle of the night during budget \nseason.  Took all the power away from local leaders; from every \nsingle local leader from towns boards, county boards.  Took it away \nfrom everybody, and they were gonna pick out where these projects \nwere sited.  And it just so happens, right in the breadbasket, the \nbreadbasket of the Revolution.  Big time in Schoharie County -- my \nhometown -- and everywhere around it.  I bet you there's rural \nmembers here tonight that have one of these projects or proposed \nprojects coming up in their -- in their district.  Not one single person, \nnot one single person is benefitting from this project.  As a matter of \nfact, I've had people from NYSERDA  come to me anonymously and \nsay, Mr. Tague, you got to help us.  This thing is a mess .  The left \nhand doesn't know what the right hand's doing.  I begged the night I \ndebated this bill to get Ag and Markets involved.  No, they didn't \nwanna hear that.  They didn't want to hear that.  Let's not have the \nCommissioner of Agriculture that knows better than anybody where \nour food comes from help make a decision on where we're gonna do \nthis.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n244The problem is this whole thing wasn't thought out.  \nIt wasn't thought out.  It was a big rush.  We got the CLCPA and we're \ngonna save the world.  What you're doing eventually is going to starve \npeople.  You're taking all the prospects for rural Upstate New York to \nactually feed people.  You're taking our land away.  I said earlier, \nhalf-a-million acres.  That's just what I know.  It could be upwards of \n750,000, and if we keep going it could be over a million.  Unless you \nguys are gonna start growing 1,000 acres or better of corn in \nManhattan, we got a serious problem on our hands.  \nAnd I'm telling you right now, this isn't a Republican \nor Democrat issue.  This is an issue of whether we love our State the \nway it is.  We have the metropolitan area.  We have the suburbs.  And \nthen we've got rural Upstate New York.  We all do our part to make \nthis State go.  But if you continue to come into our rural area that's \nbeautiful, where we have tourism, where we have agriculture, and you \ncontinue to take it away from us, we're gonna be nothing.  We're \ngonna be nothing. \nMy friends, this was a bad bill when it was in the \nbudget.  It's a bad bill last year and it's a worse bill this year.  I've \nheard many times that everybody needs to pay their fair share, \neveryone needs to pay their fair share.  So we have these large \ncorporations coming in and they're asking for a tax break.  My \nneighbor isn't getting a tax break.  The guy next to him isn't getting a \ntax break.  And we sure as hell shouldn't give a tax break to somebody \nthat's not gonna benefit our community. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n245So if you really care about all of New York State and \nevery single person in this State, you will vote no.  You will stand up \nto the large corporations, you will stand up to the Governor and \nNYSERDA  and tell them to get their act together.  If not and you are a \nrural Upstate New York legislator, you should be ashamed of yourself \nif you vote in favor of this. \nMadam Speaker, I vote no.  This is a bad bill, \nshouldn't even have came to the floor.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Palmesano. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for a few questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. LASHER:  Sure. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Thank you, Mr. Lasher.  I think \nmy colleagues covered most of the questions, but I just kind of want to \ntouch on a couple, if I may.  So this obviously sets the valuation so \nthat the New York State Department of Tax and Finance will \ndetermine the valuation of these solar assessments and wind \nassessments, correct?  That's how -- that's intention with this bill, to \nkind of codify that; is that right?  \nMR. LASHER:  It creates the -- it creates a \nstandardized methodology for the Department of Taxation and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n246Finance. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Created by the State Tax and \nFinance.  So like right now I know in my district, our -- my local IDA \nnegotiates with the local develops [sic] --\nMR. LASHER:  Yes.\nMR. PALMESANO:  -- with the wind, solar.  They \ngo in and just have those discussions.  Is that still (indiscernible) \nprocess?  \nMR. LASHER:  Nothing in this legislation would \npreclude a locality from negotiating a PILOT agreement. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Because -- and you -- I think \nyou would agree with me that a local IDA, when they're negotiating \nthey look out for the best interest of the locality, correct?  Is that a fair \nassessment, would you say?  \nMR. LASHER:  I think that nothing in this legislation \nwould preclude an IDA --\nMR. PALMESANO:  No, I --\nMR. LASHER:  -- or locality from negotiating a \nPILOT agreement. \nMR. PALMESANO:  I -- I understand that.  But let's \nsay the developers working with the local IDA and the IDA who is \nrepresenting the interests of the locality.  What if, say, the IDA brings \na proposal to the developers and the developers don't like it and they \nsay, I can go and get a better deal going to the State.  There's nothing \nstopping that developer from saying, I'm sorry, IDA, Mr. Local IDA.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n247We wanna go deal with the State and get a better valuation .  They can \ndo that, right?  Nothing precludes them from doing that under this bill, \nright?  \nMR. LASHER:  The idea here is to have a consistent, \nfair methodology that can be relied upon across the State.  But again, \nnothing precludes a developer from working something out with an \nIDA.  A developer may see it, I would imagine, as in their interest and \nworth perhaps a premium to have come to terms with the IDA as \nopposed to perhaps the slightly more --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Right.\nMR. LASHER:  -- the other route. \nMR. PALMESANO:  And I -- I appreciate you saying \nthat.  And I do recognize nothing precludes the IDA from working out \na negotiation with the developer.  But just -- I'll repeat my question.  \nThere's nothing stopping the developer if he doesn't like the deal that \nthe IDA has created, he could go the route of the State and let State \nTax and Finance work through that evaluation if he feels he can get a \nbetter deal, he can save more money by doing it, right?  That -- is that \na correct statement?  \nMR. LASHER:  That -- that's another way of saying \nthe same thing, I think, would --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.\nMR. LASHER:  -- be that if an IDA was asking for an \nexorbitant and unreasonable and arbitrary demand, that the developer \nwould have available to the developer a fair and reliable system from \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n248the State. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Sure.  I can -- I can appreciate \nthat. \nSo I know you said this has nothing do with energy \npolicy, it's a technical fix.  But is it a fair question to ask that the \nreason we're doing this is because obviously we have the CLCPA in \nplace, there's a Climate Action Council plan that says we need so \nmuch development of solar and wind, and because we have to have \nthat development of solar and wind we need -- we need to address this \npart that's out in the question?  So isn't that a fair -- that -- so even \nthough it's not an energy policy it's -- it's here to address the energy \npolicy that we have in place, especially when it -- when it relates to \nsolar and wind, which are renewable energy, correct?  Is that fair?  \nMR. LASHER:  I think it is a practical solution to the \nfact that localities often are perhaps not the best equipped.  These are \ncomplicated, relatively new ways of assessing --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Sure.\nMR. LASHER:  -- value, and this creates an even and \nreliable basis to do it around the State.  And I should note, by the way, \nbecause it was said earlier that we were somehow unique.  And I \nshould just note that there are a number of states, including Vermont \nand Iowa and Minnesota and Colorado and Illinois, that have similarly \nestablished centralized taxation of renewable energy systems. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Sure.  I -- I can understand that.\nSo, recognizing that we do need more solar and wind \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n249development, and I know this is gonna be part of it for the assessment, \ndo you understand -- do you know how much the Climate Action \nCouncil plan called for for solar development as part of their \nrecommendations?  Do you have any idea?  \nMR. LASHER:  I -- I do not know the number \noffhand. \nMR. PALMESANO:  It's 60 gigawatts of solar.  Do \nyou know how many acres of land it takes per megawatt of solar?  \nMR. LASHER:  I do not. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Eight acres of land.  Do you \nknow how many acres of land that is for 60 gigawatts?  480,000 acres \nof land.  Do you know where that land is gonna be used from in our \nState?  Where are they gonna go?  They're gonna go to Upstate New \nYork, right?  They're not gonna go to New York City.  Doubtful they'll \nbe in Long Island.  But it's gonna be in Upstate New York, the rural \nareas, correct?\nMR. LASHER:  You know --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Is that a fair -- is that a fair \nassessment?\nMR. LASHER:  My hope is that we have a lot more \nsolar in the City of New York, Mr. Palmesano. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Well, I think I'd rather see it in \nNew York City than in Upstate New York, because especially with \nour farmland.  I know the real -- and my colleague touched on this, \nand I kind of just want to reiterate that -- this point.  There -- the State \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n250Association of -- Assessors Association, one of the things they said is \nthe tax credits, the incentives to build the solar, these are not included \nin the cash flow, but the -- all the expenditures, including \ndecommission, are.  So from their argument you can't get a proper \nassessment when you're -- when you're doing that.  Why -- again, I \nguess, would -- would those tax credits be removed from the -- from \nthe cash flow and the revenue?  \nMR. LASHER:  The -- the question of whether or not \nthe tax credits would be treated as intangible assets or as revenue, that \nwas a -- that was a question that DTF wrestled with in their process.  \nThere are -- there is a question as to whether or not the State \nConstitution would prohibit that taxation of -- of those -- of those tax \ncredits.  But in the end, as a policy judgment , DTF decided to treat the \ntax credits as intangible assets and that is how -- that is what this \nlegislation follows. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Sure.  And just getting back, I \nknow it's not an energy policy but it is the assessment (indiscernible).  \nCertainly, you can -- I'm sure you can sense the frustration in the \nquestions and our position and why the frustration is because of local \ncontrol being taken away and that -- and that's whether it's from the -- \nwhether it's from the decision-making process to now the assessment \nprocess, and all this land -- this is all on Upstate land, a lot of \nfarmland.  You can -- I certainly can appreciate and understand the \nfrustration that many of us have with this policy that was passed as \npart of the budget and moving it forward.  You can understand -- I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n251mean, is it fair to say you can at least understand our frustration in this \nand having enough (indiscernible) -- \nMR. LASHER:  What I'm -- what I'm hearing is deep \nfrustration with the State's -- with probably many years of agricultural \npolicy and energy policy as it has been resolved by this Chamber, and \nI think, respectfully, that that is misplaced with regard to this bill.  \nThis bill is a technical fix --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Sure.\nMR. LASHER:  -- to a -- to a law this Chamber \npassed that simply over-delegated to an agency, and we are correcting \nthat.  That is the -- that is the four corners of this bill.  And I would -- \nas I've told Mr. Tague, I know that I and many of my colleagues \nwould welcome a deeper engagement on the issues of agricultural \npolicy and energy policy that you all are raising.  But that's not what \nthis bill is about.  This is a Real Property Tax Law legal fix.  And if \nthis Legislature wants to make sure that the -- that its will can be \neffectuated, you should vote in favor of this bill. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Mr. Lasher, I thank you for \nyour time.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker \nand my colleagues.  I think my colleagues covered it great in their \nquestions, specifically -- certainly can understand the frustration that \nwe have.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n252You know, we get to the point of where, you know, \nthe question I was asking, you know, we can negotiate -- our -- our \nlocal IDAs do much of this negotiation, but then you get to a situation \nwhere -- where the local IDA is looking out for the interests of the \nlocal community.  Then you get to a situation where a developer \nmight feel, Well, I can get a better deal going to the State , because \ntime and again we said -- we heard the sponsor say, well, State Tax \nand Finance -- State Tax and Finance is gonna be trying to do this \nvaluation.  \nHere's the problem I think many of us have:  We -- \nwe simply watched the total taking away of local control when it came \n-- comes to the siting of wind and solar projects in our Upstate \ncommunities, because it's being done in our Upstate communities.  It's \nnot being done in New York City.  It's not really being done on Long \nIsland.  But it's being done in our Upstate communities.  And what --  \nyou know, so it used to start where it would be the SEQRA process \nwhere the local town board and zoning board would have to approve \nit.  Then we went to Article 10 and there were some changes made.  \nAt least in Article 10 they had two local officials on the board to help \nwith the process to evaluate, to have input, be at the meetings to \ncomment on it.  Then that wasn't good enough, so they went to ORES, \nOffice of Renewable Energy Siting, which took total away any local \nrepresentation on it.  Now when we talked about that process they say, \nWell, we got local input.  We got a lot of local input .  Nonsense .  \nThere's no local input.  They use -- they do a few little public \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n253hearings, if the community doesn't want it they can just go and get it \napproved, and that's what's happening.  So you take away local control \nof the siting of these projects.  Then assessors, if you want take away \nany local control from the assessors who are tasked with assessing the \nvaluation of projects and -- and things in their -- their communities.  \nSo now what happens?  Now it's gonna go to State control.  \nSo that brings up a great deal of frustration to many \nof us in Upstate New York because it's taking away much of our \nUpstate land.  And I already mentioned it; 60 gigawatts of solar.  \nThat's 480,000 acres of land for solar that the Climate Action Council \nPlan is calling for.  That's gonna be Upstate land.  That's gonna be \nprime farmland.  You know, you wonder why we are frustrated.  And \nwe're not benefitting from that, whether it's these (indiscernible).  And \nthen 90 percent of our generation in Upstate New York is \nemission-free.  Ninety percent of the emissions -- 90 percent of the \ngeneration in New York City, Downstate, is fossil fuel-based.  So all \nthis is being done to deal with New York City.  How about New York \nCity puts the solar panels on the roofs there?  Try to figure out a way \nand you do it instead of putting on the backs of our Upstate farming \ncommunities and our Upstate areas?  \nThe public doesn't really want this.  They don't.  They \nsee these wind farms and solar farms going over.  One acre -- again, \none -- one megawatt of solar is eight acres.  For wind, you're talking \nabout 30 -- 30 acres per megawatt.  That's a lot of acreage being taken \nup by wind and solar.  And it's -- it's intermittent energy, so it's not \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n254really helping provide reliability to the grid.  Even the NYISO has said \nthat.  So this gets really, really frustrating to us when we see this \nhappening time and time again.  There's a lawsuit in place.  Why not \nlet it play out?   \nBut I just think that's the frustration you -- you will -- \nyou heard from us in this debate.  That's the frustration heard from us \nin the past couple years when we've done this debate.  That's the \nfrustration here in the lawsuit.  It just feels Upstate New York is just \ngetting slugged in the gut or in the chin time and time again with these \npolicies that we, quite frankly, don't want.  But it is other people who \nare saying this is what we gotta do because it's the goals, it's the \nmandates we need to meet.  \nI know this is a technical fix, but it all stems back to \nthe energy policy that's being advanced in the State of New York.  I \ndon't need to go through all that again; I did that earlier.  But that's the \nfrustration.  And I wish there'd be some recognition of that from my \ncolleagues from Downstate.  And from my colleagues from Upstate to \nsay more on this, because this is becoming a frustrating issue which \nwe see time and time again.\nSo I appreciate the -- the sponsor's time on this \nlegislation and answering our questions.  But certainly, I hope he \nsenses the frustration we have on this issue, the concerns we have on \nthis issue, because they're big concerns.  They're legitimate concerns.  \nAnd I think they need to be taken into consideration as we move \nforward.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n255So for that reason, Mr. -- Madam Speaker, my \ncolleagues, I'm gonna be voting in the negative on this legislation and \nI urge my colleagues to do the same.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Gandolfo. \nMR.

ANGELINO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nThis is the third time I've been through this bill, and now it is in a \nlawsuit.  And I don't think judges appreciate when they've ruled on \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n256something, then the -- the bill gets amended just to add confusion to \nthe issue, thinking that it's correcting something.  It was bad to begin \nwith. \nI got to tell you, the people I represent, who I live \nwith, they're just sick of Upstate New York being a colony for New \nYork City.  You take our water from Delaware County, Schoharie \nCounty, Ulster, Greene.  Now you're taking our land.  You're turning \nbucolic views into industrial sites with nothing but steel and solar \npanels.  And if you need -- if we're right now at a half-million acres, I \ndon't know how much more you're gonna take.  When does it end to \nhave enough power for New York City?  You've got to decide, do you \nwant lights on or do you want to eat?  \nI just wish that this industry did not need propping \nup.  And this bill is just another crutch; one of the many that we keep \nproviding to the solar and wind turbine industry.  It's constant, \nconstantly in need of tweaking, and it needs things that just have to \nkeep helping it along.  Nobody wants it, it's not a viable industry.  And \nplease, please don't even bring another draft of this legislation before \nthis Body until every roof, every wall, every parking lot in the five \nboroughs is covered with solar.  See how much you can get down \nthere where it's needed before you come Upstate and start taking our \ntillable farmland and our views, our green spaces.\nI'll be voting no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Angelino in the \nnegative.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n257Mr. Tague to explain his vote. \nMR. TAGUE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I still \nlook up there and see a lot of awful green buttons pushed.  And I just \ndon't understand it, because many of us stand here and when a bill \nfrom the City comes that's gonna help the people that you represent, \nmany of us vote yes when it's a local bill.  This right here affects local, \nand it affects a lot of the people that feed you.  That feed you.  And I \njust can't believe that people -- and especially the people that always \ncry about Corporate America, that's who you're feeding money to, is \nCorporate America.  Not the taxpayers in rural Upstate New York. \nThis is a terrible bill.  Vote your conscience for once.  \nThis bill needs be voted down.  If you vote yes on this then we know \nwhere you stand.  You're more about corporate greed than you are \nabout putting food in your mouth or your constituents' mouth.  \nI vote absolutely no.  Garbage bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Tague in the \nnegative.\nMr. Bologna to explain his vote. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nRepresenting a very rural community in -- in Niagara County, my \ncolleague Mr. Tague actually sounds like a lot of the people I \nrepresent.  Honestly, it sounds like you're at -- I'm at a Niagara County \nFarm Bureau breakfast, to be perfectly honest with you.  But that -- \nthat is the type of emotion and feelings that -- that these bills produce.  \nWe have a bill today, you know, talking about and outlining natural \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n258gas and how people in Western New York and Upstate New York are \n-- are -- are pleading to allow us to have that -- that reliable energy, \nand, you know, no, can't do that.  But then at the same token, the \njustification  of this bill says that incentivizing and encouraging the \nexpansion of wind and solar projects is an important part of the \nclimate change solution.  Pick one.  If -- if you -- if we, you know, \nloved it, so fine, but let us keep our natural gas.  \nIn -- in a lot of ways this is very frustrating.  But my \n-- my colleague Mr. Tague has given us a very good embodiment of \nwhy this is such an emotional and frustrating issue for so many of us \nin Upstate New York because a large sentiment in Upstate is that we \nare providing energy at the expense of our land for New York City.  \nSo with that and on behalf of my residents in Upstate \nNew York, I will be voting in the negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Bologna in the \nnegative.\nMr. Manktelow to explain his vote. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nI just wanted to share this with everyone here in the \nChamber that as a farmer, as a person that worked the ground, that \nmade that ground the best that it could be to produce the best \nvegetables and the best crops for New Yorkers, I know the love of the \nland.  And I was thinking about this as we were talking, and I'll just \nput this into perspective.  An out-of-state company comes in, they take \nanother 2,000 acres and you have no say in it.  Oh, and by the way, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n259that 2,000 acres is New York City Park, Central Park.  A company \ncomes in, takes that beautiful park area, turns it into a wind -- \nwindmill or a solar project.  All that beautiful land and ponds and \nwater and vegetation and animals and fish are now gone because we \nneed solar power.  We have to work together to save all of our \nproperties, to save our land.  And let's do this in a respectful way and \nlet's help accomplish what we want to get, but really take a hard look \nat not giving up anymore farmland.  Just like you would not want to \ngive up Central Park to put solar projects in.\nSo thank you, Madam Speaker, and I'll be voting in \nthe negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Manktelow in \nthe negative.\nMr. Ra to explain his vote. \nMR. RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Obviously, I \nam not from Upstate, but I hear my colleagues talking about this issue.  \nAnd, you know, looking at this court decision as it was working its \nway through the courts, the Assessors Association is telling us, despite \nthe underlying statute, says they need to be consulted with.  They're \ntelling us they were not consulted with in any meaningful way.  And \nthe decision talks about the fact that there was a dispute that the \nstakeholders could not come to an agreement with, and that's part of \nwhy they ended up concluding that there was an unconstitutional \ndelegation of power.  So while this is just dealing with that aspect of \nit, I think it further cuts out the assessors, who are named in this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n260statute as needing to be consulted with.  And we have heard from, I \nwould say, relatively small municipalities that there -- stand to lose \nmillions of dollars, which -- you think about a large town, county, city \nDownstate that has a very large budget, that doesn't seem like a lot of \nmoney, that is a huge impact on an Upstate municipality.\nSo I'm gonna be voting in the negative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Ra in the \nnegative.\nMr. Eachus to explain his vote. \nMR. EACHUS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nallowing me to comment on this.  I'm neither from the City, nor am I \nfrom Upstate.  I'm in the Mid-Hudson Valley.  We have lots of farms \nin the Mid-Hudson Valley.  And of the farmers I spoke to who have \nsold their farms, they've done it for their own benefit.  They've made \nlots of money by selling their land, and they liked that.  And it's \ninteresting, my colleagues who profess to be farmers have never once \nmentioned the term \"agrisolar.\"  Agrisolar actually increases the \nproduction of much of the farmland when done properly.  Agrisolar \nallows you to put up solar panels, which many of the farmers are \ndoing now, as well as raise crops under them, as well as to have \nlivestock raised under them and the like.  And yet these folks are \nconstantly commenting on, We're losing farmland.  We're not losing \nfarmland unless those farmers want to give it up for that.  They can \nuse agrisolar and actually increase their production with it if they \nwanted to. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n261I want to thank the sponsor of this bill and I am \nvoting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Eachus in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Lemondes to explain his vote. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nThis bill is bad for a lot of reasons; most of them have been covered.  \nOne thing that I want to remind everyone of, especially the people that \nare voting yes on this, is every acre of land that's encumbered with a \nsolar panel raises feed prices for other animals and raises food prices.  \nOur energy problems, together as a State, will not be solved without \nnuclear -- without nuclear power.  \nThe people that I represent don't want these wind \nfarms in our district.  I don't want one on my farm.  And I can attest to \nthe pressure that people feel from these companies trying to push \nthese solar projects on our rural farmland.  A lot of people have \nsubmitted to this because they don't know any better, and they've been \ntaken advantage of completely, in a hundred different ways.  How \nabout a solar project without a decommissioning clause or without a \nrent escalation clause, which is what a lot of people have been duped \ninto?  Let's not forget that.  Let's not forget elderly people.  What if \nthey were your parents or grandparents that are counting on that \nmoney for their retirement, yet at the end they're gonna have a mess \nthat they have to clean up.  Who's gonna pay for that?  Probably the \nlandowner if there's no decommissioning clause in the contract. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n262The farce of the CLCPA that we can solve our energy \nproblems without nuclear power is a joke.  Small modular nuclear like \nour --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nLemondes.  How do you vote?  \nMR. LEMONDES:  I vote no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Lemondes in \nthe negative. \nMr. Palmesano to explain his vote. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes, thank you, Madam \nSpeaker, my colleagues.  The comment was made that farmers are \nselling their property and they love it.  I don't blame the farmer.  The \nreason the farmers are selling their property is because they're getting \nscrewed over by the policies that continue to come out of this House.  \nYou talk about the Farm Labor Act that we passed several years ago.  \nThat was putting the screws to the farmer.  The energy policy, the \nCLCPA is advancing.  That's putting the screws to the farmer.  Then \nwe have the ridiculous proposal out there, let's limit just to 700 cows.  \nThat -- that's gonna be great to help meet the expansion of projects \nlike Chobani.  It's short-sighted.  I don't blame the farmer; it's the \npolicies that come out of this House that are causing problems for our \nfarming community so they can try to get some money out of their \nfarm because they can't make money farming because of the policies \ncome [sic] out of this State.  So let's not blame them.  I'm not blaming \nthe farmer.  And remember, like my colleague says, you know, if \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n263there's no -- if there's no farms, there's no food.  \nI know we all want to see food at a reasonable cost all \nacross the State and New York City, wherever it may be.  Things like \nthis make it much more difficult, so I'm gonna be voting no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Palmesano in \nthe negative.\nMr. Friend to explain his vote. \nMR. FRIEND:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  This \nbill doesn't limit solar panels to just agrivoltaics.  And across my \nentire district, marshland, forestland, farmland is being picked up and \nturned into solar farms at an alarming rate.  And they're not sitting \nhigh enough to grow something underneath it.  You can't get an \nanimal underneath those solar panels that are being put in right now.  \nThe number of farmers that have to come to me and said, What am I \ngonna do next year, Chris, because they're putting a solar farm on the \nland that I used to lease to grow the crops to feed my animals?  Where \nam I gonna get the food?  Either they have to sell their farm and leave \nthe State now, or they have to buy food from somewhere else to feed \nthe animals on their farm and ship it in.   \nThis was a poorly thought-out bill and I vote no. \n(Applause) \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Friend in the \nnegative.  \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n264The bill is passed. \nPage 12, Rules Report No. 498, the Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  Senate No. S00700, Rules Report No. \n498, Senator Krueger (A04664, Epstein, Taylor, Burdick, Zinerman).  \nAn act to amend the Tax Law, in relation to the enforcement of \ndelinquent tax liabilities by means of the suspension of licenses to \noperate a motor vehicle.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Epstein. \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Thank you.  Under current State Tax \nLaw, the Commissioner of Tax and Finance can ask the DMV to \nrevoke someone's driver's license.  What we're doing is adjusting that \nfigure towards inflation, providing exemptions for people with \nincomes below 250 percent of poverty, and granting the Tax \nCommissioner further authority to waive suspensions if the taxpayer \ncan, you know, provide a case of equities in their case.  And it also \ngives the Tax Commissioner the ability to go after taxpayers who \naffirmatively avoid taxes for tax collection that are below $10,000. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gandolfo. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor please yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Happy to. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n265ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So first, we had a little \ndiscussion about this earlier but I just want to clarify a couple of \nthings here.  So now the -- the ability -- the Department of Tax and \nFinance currently has the ability to suspend a license for anybody who \nhas a tax delinquency of over $10,000?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Yeah, that is correct. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Do you know about how often \nthat happens?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Regularly enough.  I don't know the \noverall number of New Yorkers who have their suspension, but it's a \nreg -- pretty regular behavior, from my understanding.  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So there's currently no \nexclusions on the ability of Tax and Finance to do this?\nMR. EPSTEIN:  They can't exclude if someone has \nchild support arrears.  That is currently excluded under the statue. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So now this would just \nexclude individuals on public assistance, SSI.  Individuals who do not \nexceed 250 percent of the federal poverty level, and/or the payment of \npast-due liabilities that would create a financial hardship for them?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Exactly.  But they have to -- the \nCommissioner will have to determine based on the application \nwhether the -- that they agree.  The Commissioner has to decide \nwhether that is actually a liability and then they can waive that \nobligation. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n266MR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Now, is that -- in terms of \nthe federal poverty level, does that apply only to individuals?  What if \nthey file jointly?  Would it go by the chart of --  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Whatever the federal poverty level is \nfor the family size that they're in. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Okay.  Now, so it will go \nby the... okay.  Now, currently does a warning go out before a license \nis suspended if you have a tax delinquency?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Yeah, they -- they get 60-day notice \nbefore the suspension occurs, and people can challenge the \nsuspension.  That's already existing under statute.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So they have the ability to \nchallenge.  Could you argue that leaving Tax and Finance with the \nability to suspend it and send out a warning to some of these \nindividuals might bring them in the door to maybe cut a deal for a \npayment plan?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  I don't think that changes that \npower.  Actually, I think it gives them additional power for people to \nactually below their $10,000 threshold if they intentionally seek to \nevade the disclosure.  So that's additional power.  But it also gives \nthem the authority to enter into payment plans for people in a much \nmore expansive way, determining based on all the factors whether \nthey determine that the person should get into a payment plan and not \nget their license suspended.  Another thing I'll add, especially if \nsomeone's around our State -- we talked a lot about Upstate a few \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n267minutes ago.  It's hard to get around the State, especially outside of \nNew York City, without a driver's license.  And if you're employed \nand you get your license suspended, the ability to go to work is further \nrestricted. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Right.  And I fully recognize the \nCatch-22 that if you have your license suspended, how are you getting \noff to work to pay down your delinquency.  But I think there could be \na balancing act here.  I feel that if you remove the ability what's -- for \nTax and Finance to even have that threat of suspension, why would \nsomeone come in and get on a payment plan to pay off that debt over \na period of time?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Well, it's still the threat of \nsuspension.  We're just including people who are very low-income, \nsomeone who's on public assistance, Social Security or 250 percent of \npoverty below.  It's a small category of people we're excluding who \nare extremely low income.  In addition, they're not -- they still have \nthe obligation.  So you can still garnish wages, you can do other \nthings.  You just won't be able to suspend their license, which is, in \nsome ways, a critical thing for people to get back on their feet to be \nable to get around this great State. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So wages still could be \ngarnished --\n(Indiscernible/cross-talk) \nMR. EPSTEIN:  All those rights are still available to \nthem.   \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n268MR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  And now, is there any \nkind of means test?  Is it based on the prior year's tax return?  \nMR. EPSTEIN:  Yeah, based on the tax returns to \ndetermine whether they're below the poverty or they're currently on \npublic assistance or getting Social Security. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Now, is there any other \nmeans testing, whether they have any assets they could liquify to pay \ndown the debt?  If -- you know, say someone lost their job in the prior \nyear but still had a second property or a savings account with a decent \namount of money in it. \nMR. EPSTEIN:  I mean, Tax and Finance has all that \ninformation, so they're making the determination based on all the \nevidence before them.  If you're on public assistance you can't have, \nlike, a million dollars in the bank.  It's under -- under the rules of the \nState of New York.  You can't have that kind of money.  So for public \nassistance or Social Security, there are real limitations on how much \nmoney you can have.  People at 250 percent of poverty below, we're \nlooking at, you know, kind of a balance of the equities and \ninformation.  People above that, it's still the Tax and Finance \nDepartment to be able to make that determination.  And the additional \npower that we're giving them for people below the threshold, I think \nit's critical as well, especially for people who might be trying to hide \nthose assets, we're giving them additional power to suspend licenses \nfor people below that if they're trying to hide their assets.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Those are all the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n269questions I had for you.  Thank you.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill briefly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  I appreciate the sponsor \nanswering some of those questions.  It does raise a Catch-22 that if \nsomeone is behind on their taxes and is a low-income individual and \nyou take away their ability to travel to work, how are they going to \npay down what they owe?  However, I feel that removing the ability \nfor Tax and Finance to suspend that license is removing, I guess, an \nincentive for someone to come in and make a deal to get right on their \nback taxes.  And with the way this State spends money, I think we \nneed every incentive to bring in those tax revenues because we'll \nprobably run out of it eventually. \nThank you, Madam Speaker.  I will be voting vote no \nand I encourage my colleagues to do the same. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect April 1st. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS.

EPSTEIN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I rise \nto explain my vote.  This is a very simple bill that doesn't affect the \nability of our State to collect taxes, but understands, especially with \nlow-income New Yorkers, losing a driver's license can mean not being \nable to work, feed their family or survive in our great State.  It's a \nreally simple fix to ensure that our tax delinquency dollars are \ncollected, but also to ensure that New Yorkers who need that driver's \nlicense to be able to continue to work in this State will be able to do \nthat. \nI want to thank the Speaker, the Majority Leader and \nall my colleagues.  This has been -- it's been a joy and a pleasure and I \nwill be voting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Epstein in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n271affirmative.\nMr. Hevesi to explain his vote. \nMR.

BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker, for allowing me to explain my vote on this bill.  \nImagine you wake up one morning in your apartment \nyou've lived in for years with your mother, father, or even just a \nlongtime friend or roommate, and all of a sudden there's a death with \nthe main leaseholder and all of the remaining people in the apartment \nsoon have to vacate because there was no process to succeed the \nleaseholder in time.  I remember clear as day when I got a call from \none of my best friends, Edwige Edouard, whose mother, Mrs. \nEdouard, had passed.  His father, his mother's husband, was not on the \nlease.  This was a household of Haitian immigrants who came to this \ncountry seeking an opportunity -- opportunity in life.  They paid their \ntaxes, raised their kids, and the household eventually became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens.  \nI called NYCHA immediately to see what were the \npolicies for succession of a spouse and there were none.  It was sad.  \nWe had to move this senior citizen, Mr. Edouard elsewhere.  He later \npassed.  Since then, NYCHA, Legal Aid and the housing advocates \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n273amended the policies to include a broader base of people beyond \nfamily members to succeed the apartment in NYCHA.  This bill is to \nmodify the policies allowing NYCHA to make it even more \nprogressive in the future.  Succession rights save households in \nNYCHA apartment from becoming homeless.  If a family member, a \nspouse or partner that has passed away or left and they have lived with \nfor years prior, they will be able to focus on their grieving versus \nneeding to try to find a new apartment to live in.   \nThere are over 300 developments in NYCHA with \nmore than 160,000 apartments; 500,000 (indiscernible-cross-talk) --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Ms. \nBichotte Hermelyn.  How do you vote?  \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  So with this to \nprotect the vulnerable population (indiscernible/cross-talk) -- \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  How do you vote, \nMs. Bichotte Hermelyn?\nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  I will be voting in \nthe affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Bichotte \nHermelyn in the affirmative.\nMs. Walsh to explain her vote. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  So, I \nalso will be voting in favor of this legislation because my reading of it \nis that it really just requires NYCHA to enumerate in some written \nform the policies that are already in place surrounding an individual's  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n274ability to apply for continued residency or to take over residency \nshould a tenant of record leave a NYCHA public housing unit.  That's \nbecause of amendments made in this bill language that state that \nNYCHA policies and procedures include and shall continue to include \npolicies and procedures allowing individuals to claim succession \nrights.  So because NYCHA will only be able to create a policy that \nreiterates and is consistent with existing laws and regulations, I \nbelieve that this -- this bill is -- is all right with me.\nSo I'll be in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nPage 12, Rules Report No. 546, the Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A00225-A, Rules \nReport No. 546, Magnarelli, Hunter.  An act to amend the Public \nAuthorities Law, in relation to commuter passes on the New York \nState Thruway in the Syracuse area; and providing for the repeal of \nsuch provisions upon expiration thereof.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Mr. \nMagnarelli, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced. \nAn explanation has been requested.\nMr. Magnarelli. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n275MR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  The \nbill would direct the Thruway Authority to issue annual short-distance \ncommuter permits for free travel in the Syracuse area between certain \nexits; 34-A, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, will the sponsor \nyield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  So just a few \nquestions on this, really.  So why -- why are we gonna allow people to \ntravel for free during those -- in those five exits, potentially?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, you've been through \nSyracuse lately or the Central New York area?\nMS. WALSH:  I have, yeah. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  We have the I-81 project \ngoing on.  It's going to take another five years.  And in the next year \nthey're going to start taking down the viaducts that run through the \nmiddle of Syracuse.  So the idea is to allow another route around the \nCity during the period of construction. \nMS. WALSH:  So this will just be temporary and \nthen as soon as that project is completed it will be lifted?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  The bill sunsets in five years, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n276December 31, 2030. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  I do like the fact that if -- \nthere's -- there's something that was written in the bill that basically \nsays that if it looks like there's a tremendous loss of revenue, then \nthere could be, like, a readjustment of the -- of the plan.  Can you just \ntalk about that a little bit?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, I can.  Okay.  It -- it \ngives the Authority flexibility in establishing the toll rates so that -- so \nlong as net revenue will meet or exceed the net revenue requirement.  \nIt also allows -- well, the bond resolution allows the Authority to \nreduce tolls for use of commuting or other privileges based on \nfrequency, volume, occupancy, congestion pricing, et cetera.  The \nAuthority could also restrict use of the permit to peak commuter hours \nand if an independent audit shows a significant revenue loss, the \nThruway could charge a discounted fee.  So there's a bunch of \ndifferent things that could be done if need be. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  And it was especially that last \npart that I was happy to see that there is flexibility put into it so it's not \njust for the next five years anybody who gets this permit, and the \npermit you'll get -- you would get for free.  That's the original idea, is \nyou get it for free. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Right. \nMS. WALSH:  But then down the road, no pun \nintended, if there -- if they do an audit and the audit shows that there's \na significant loss of revenue --  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n277MR. MAGNARELLI:  Right. \nMS. WALSH:  -- then there could be an adjustment.  \nAnd maybe you would offer a discount, the permits could be gotten at \na discount on the cash cost per mile or something like that.  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Right.\nMS. WALSH:  So there is some flexibility.  And I do \n-- I do appreciate that part of it.  I think where some of our members \nmight be a little less happy is they're gonna say, Well, why not my part \nof the Thruway?  Why -- why -- why this part of the Thruway , you \nknow, and not my part of the Thruway?   So how do you -- how would \nyou respond to that?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, I understand that, and \nwhat I said initially is that this is just for the period of construction or \nreconstruction of 1-81.  And the reason for these exits being allowed \nto be used in this way is because we're going to have extraordinary \ncircumstances in Downtown Syracuse where we're going to have \ntraffic jams and things like that.  We're trying to make it as easy as \npossible for people to get around, and also as easy as possible and as \nsafe and healthy as possible for the people who live in the areas that \nare being reconstructed. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So is this anywhere -- I'm -- \nand I don't know the answer to this, that's why I'm asking.  But the -- \nthe Micron that's supposed to be coming in, is that anywhere near any \nof these exits?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Not really -- well, yes.  I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n278mean, it's near the exits as you go by Syracuse.  But this isn't a Micron \ndeal in any way, shape or form.  This is strictly an I-81 reconstruction \nproposal. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Yeah, I was just curious about \nthat because I thought, well, we might be back here, some of us in \n2030, and then we're gonna be given another reason why we should be \nextending or continuing this because of maybe Micron coming in. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, I hope I'm talking to \nyou again in that year. \nMS. WALSH:  I do, too.  I do, too.  But I -- I hope we \naren't gonna do that, because the -- you know, in general.  Because I \nthink this is kind of precedent-setting and I think that that might be a \nconcern that some members might have, that we're doing it for, you \nknow, this area then, you know, maybe somebody down in the \nHudson Valley is going to say, Boy, we have a big project, too.  We \nneed to do that , you know, in our area , too.  So... \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, again, I'd like everyone \nto come to Syracuse, see what we're doing and see what a major \nconstruction this is in the middle of the City. \nMS. WALSH:  Well, they said that -- some people \nhave said that Albany is lovely in the summertime; I'm sure Syracuse \nis as well. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  That could be.   \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, it is.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n279MS. WALSH:  Yeah.  All right.\nLet's see.  Now, I saw that back in 2017 our former \ncolleague Mr. Thiele had a bill that I think was doing -- trying to do \nthe same thing, but the Governor vetoed it.  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. WALSH:  But this project that you're talking \nabout, this significant project in the inside of Syracuse, that wasn't \ngoing on at that time, was it?  What was the rationale for doing this \nbill back in '17, if you know?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I -- I don't know, but --\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  -- I'd love to talk to Fred and \nget him on the phone, that's for sure. \nMS. WALSH:  Well, I was -- it was funny because I \nwas wondering, as a -- as a member from Long Island, I was \nwondering why he would be carrying a bill that would impact, you \nknow, your area.  But I don't know if that was because maybe he was \non Transportation. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  The only thing was -- was he \nChair of Local Governments at the time?  That could have been.  \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, maybe that's the reason.  I don't \nknow.  All right.  I think that -- those are pretty much the questions \nthat I've got.  At this point --\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Thank you.\nMS. WALSH:  -- I'll just go on the bill, please.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n280Thank you, Mr. Magnarelli.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  So, I \nmean, just a couple of quick points to make.  You know, I think that, \nyou know, under the Public Authorities Law, the State pledged that it \nwould not limit or alter the rights vested in the Authority to establish \nand collect fees to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the \nbondholders, nor in any way impair the rights and remedies of the \nbondholders until the bonds are fully met and discharged.  So in other \nwords, you know, we approved these fees to be charged exit-by-exit to \ntry to support the Thruway Authority, and I think, you know, maybe \nthey're -- the Thruway Authority isn't as -- as hated as maybe some \nother agencies, I guess.  But there's some -- there's some unpleasant \nfeelings towards the Thruway Authority that they've been collecting \nfees for a really long time and probably have paid for the Thruway \nmany, many times over and yet here they are still charging money.  So \nthis is an alteration in the -- the structure of charging at each exit.  \nAnd, you know, toll revenues are supposed to be all pledged for the \npayment of bonds issued under the Authority's general revenue bond \nresolution.  So, you know, I was thinking that, you know, this is kind \nof like the reverse of NIMBY, \"Not in My Backyard.\"  We're all \ngonna be like PIMBYs, because we're gonna be like, Please, let this \nbe in my back yard so that as I travel exit , you know, exit 23, 24, 25 \nand 26 to get back to my house , I won't have to pay any tolls at all.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n281That would be super .  And, you know, I don't know, the Governor \nwhen he voted this in 2017, this iden -- nearly identical bill, he was \narguing that this bill would negatively impact the Authority's bond \nrating and increase the cost of borrowing by the Authority, and \nmaintain that this bill would set a precedent to allow other \njurisdiction s to seek this type of reduction, thus resulting in greater \nrevenue loss for the State, which was not accounted for by the State in \nits financial plan.  I don't know anything about the -- the whole bond \nrating thing.  I don't know.  But that was the reason given in the -- in \nGovernor Cuomo's veto back in 2017.  And I did try to address during \ndebate the idea of it being potentially precedent-setting. \nI do like parts of the legislation.  I like the fact that it \nhas built-in flexibility in the sense that, you know, if this audit gets \ndone and they figure out that, Hey, we're just losing too much revenue.  \nWe really need to make an ad justment.  That can be done.  And also \nthat although the permits, at least initially, will be issued free of \ncharge, that depending on how things work out with revenue loss over \nthe next five years, there could be a charge that's maybe at a \ndiscounted rate per mile for these permits.  So I do like that aspect of \nit.  But I would expect that there will be votes maybe on both sides of \nthe issue, and I just appreciate that the sponsor gave me a little time to \njust try to shine a little light on the pros and the cons of this piece of \nlegislation. \nSo thank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n282Mr. Gallahan. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWill the sponsor yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, Madam Speaker.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  I have one question.  Is there a \nfee for the permit?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Right now it'll be free.  \nMR. GALLAHAN:  It'll be free.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  But it could be if there's an \naudit and it shows that it's needed. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  Okay.  So currently, how do --  \nam I gonna be able to online through my E-ZPass account and apply \nfor this permit and have it applied to my E-ZPass tag?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I -- I think they do.  And they \ndo have a permit program as we speak where you get a discounted \npermit for the Thruway. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  They do.  You're right.  I \ncurrently participate.  It's $80 a year annual fee.  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  $88.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  It give me X amount of miles on \nthe Thruway for free and then a reduced rate for the next exit and then \nregular fees after that.  So, I mean, that's available to anybody in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n283State currently.  It's an $80 fee.  Thank you very much.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  I -- I can appreciate this.  My \ndistrict runs from Ontario County to Madison County to Broome \nCounty.  But I've got a problem because I've got five of the Finger \nLakes that run down through my district, and I cannot take a boat \nacross these five Finger Lakes.  So I have to get on 90, the Thruway, \ngo all the way to Syracuse, Exit 39, jump 690 and then go down 81.  \nAnd I can tell you right now, it's not a pleasant trip.  There's a lot of \nconstruction going on down there, and any kind of relief that I can get \ngoing down the Thruway currently will at least make me feel a little \nbit better and keep the road rage out of my head. \nSo I will -- I will be in favor of this bill.  I will be \nvoting in favor of this bill, and we'll see what happens in the next few \nyears and hopefully I won't have to pay another fee to get this permit.  \nSo, thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Reilly. \nMR. REILLY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield for a question?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n284MR. REILLY:  Thank you so much, Mr. Magnarelli. \nSo with this -- with this legislation, was there any \nmoney designated in the budget to reimburse the Thruway Authority?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  No, sir. \nMR. REILLY:  So we didn't have to -- we didn't have \nto have an offset in the budget to reimburse them at all?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  No.  You know, I believe that \nit isn't going to be that significant.  And that as far as bonds and \neverything else are concerned, we're going to be able to show, or the \nThruway Authority will be able to show, that it has the revenues \nwithout this, without these tolls in these few exits, to make sure that \nall requirements are met. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  So the reason why I ask that \nquestion is each year, residents of Staten Island in Richmond County, \nwe have to fight for our resident discount on the Verrazano Bridge \nfrom another authority, right, the -- the MTA, and there has to be an \nallocation in the budget to offset our resident discount to go over the \nVerrazano Bridge because we only have bridges and one ferry to get \nhome.  So that's why -- do you think there's an opportunity where next \nyear there may be a need to designate money in the budget to \nreimburse the Thruway Authority?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I -- I have not talked to \nanyone about designating money in the budget for any of these types \nof programs.  \nMR. REILLY:  All right.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n285MR. MAGNARELLI:  I think you have to come up \nwith at least a rationale as to why revenues will be sufficient to cover \nwhatever requirements the Authority has. \nMR. REILLY:  Another -- another reason I'm asking \nis usually when we have bills like this that have a fiscal impact on our \nauthorities, we see it when we go through -- when we have bills in \ncommittees that if there's a fiscal imp -- implication there has to be a \nbudget allocation.  At least that's the answer we get with our bills on \nthe Minority side that get held in committee.  So do you foresee that \nbeing an issue?  Meaning the issue of fiscal -- fiscal allocation for this. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I don't.  And I think the \nrationale is what I discussed with our colleague a little bit earlier \nabout the flexibility built into the bill, that if there is a need for those \nfees to be increased or to be implemented, then the Thruway \nAuthority could do that.  The other part of this is that this is not \nforever.  This is a short period of time during a period of construction.  \nThere is a need for it.  And I'm not saying there isn't a need someplace \nelse, but this is quite different.  It's not a need that's going to go on \nforever; it's a need that's there during a construction period.  And what \nwe're trying to do is just give a little flexibility to the Authority and \nsay, Look it, if there is no need for these fees during this short period \nof time, it will affect a lot of people, their health and their safety. \nMR. REILLY:  So were there any numbers that were \ngiven that -- projections for the five years how much revenue the \nThruway would lose?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n286MR. MAGNARELLI:  I think we had this number, \nam I correct?  \n(Conferencing)\nYeah, it's kind of -- with the -- we don't have any real \nnumbers from any of the exits, per se, since 2016, if I'm correct.  And \nit could be $11 million a year total. \nMR. REILLY:  $11 million a year. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes.  That's on the permit. \nMR. REILLY:  So what are those -- you said \nsomething about 2016.  So are those numbers from 2016 before rates \nwent up?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, revenue from current \npermit holders -- this is what Mr. Gallagher [sic] had spoken about -- \nif you have a-- a permit.  For permit holders in the exits where this \npermit would be allowed was $1.3 million back in 2016.  $1.3 million.\nMR. REILLY:  So nine years ago, 1 --\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yup.  Yup.\nMR. REILLY:  All right.  So we're looking at least $6 \nmillion if we don't allocate for revenue that went up and maybe more \npeople that live there. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Could be.  Could be.  But we \nalso have the flexibility of adding to the revenue if we have to.  If it \ncauses any problems. \nMR. REILLY:  So why not just start with a \ndiscounted -- an even further discount in the area?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n287MR. MAGNARELLI:  It's zero.  \nMR. REILLY:  No, no.  That's what I'm saying.  Why \nnot start with a paid discount?  Like, have them pay for the permit \ninstead of just giving it away for zero?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, I -- I think there's two \nfolds to the bill, or the rationale that I had for this bill is to have \npeople use it.  Right now they're not used to getting on the Thruway to \nget from the north side of our county to the south side of the county or \neast and west.  We want them to use it so they don't go through the \nmiddle of the City of Syracuse, which they do now because of I-81 \nand 690, which criss-cross each other.  Those routes are going to be \ndown.  So the idea was to get them to use a different route. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Magnarelli.  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  You're welcome. \nMR. REILLY:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. REILLY:  So the -- the question I have is how \nmuch money is going to be asked of us in the budget next year?  \nBecause if we're looking at projections that are from 2016 and we are \nin 2025, ten years will be next year, I'm sure that the money that those \nexits took in is probably substantially more than the $1.3 million that \nwas just said was allocated -- well, taken in in revenue in 2016. \nIt's just disheartening when you come from an island \nthat there's only four bridges; three for the Port Authority, which is \nNew York and New Jersey, and one, the Verrazano Bridge with the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n288MTA.  And that's the only way we can go in and out on our own by \ndriving.  And every year we have to fight tooth-and-nail to keep the \nresident discount.  Now, that toll on the Verrazano Bridge is $19 now.  \nResident discounts, yes.  We are very thankful for getting the resident \ndiscount which equates to about $6, just under $6.  But we still pay.  \nThe reason why I bring that up is because it was mentioned during this \ndebate that there are gonna be other areas that are asking, Why not us?   \nBut it's something to think about.  This is going to be for five years.  \nAnd just like other legislation that has come before this Body, take for \ninstance -- and I know I'm gonna speak on something else -- the speed \ncameras.  It was a five-year demonstration program.  It was extended \nin year two.  Back in 2014 it was expended -- extended in 2016.  The \nreason why I bring that up is because, yes, we all have good intentions \nusually when these bills say Oh, it's gonna be for five years and then \nall of a sudden it's extended.  \nI just want us to be cognizant that when we say that \nwe're going to do something, let's make sure we stick to it.  Because if \nthis gets extended, I'm sure there are gonna be other areas in the State \nthat are gonna be upset.  And they're going to say, Why not us?   We \nhave construction on the Staten Island Expressway.  We have \nconstruction on the Gowanus Expressway, as my Brooklyn colleagues \nwill tell you.  I lived in that area in Brooklyn.  That's been under \nconstruction since I was, like, nine, and that was a long time ago.  So \nplease just keep that in mind.   \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n289ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Stirpe. \nMR. STIRPE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for a couple of questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. STIRPE:  Now, isn't the difference of what our \ncolleague was talking about and what's happening in Central New \nYork is that his cars are already going over those roads all the time.  In \nCentral New York, the drivers who drive locally are not on the \nThruway.  So the actual amount of tolls shouldn't really go down \nbecause these are people who don't normally go on that road; isn't that \ncorrect?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, that is correct as far as \nthe additional ones, but I understand that some other people might \ntake advantage of it.  But you're right. \nMR. STIRPE:  Okay.  So in this situation it's -- it's \nreally different than in other situations that people have been talking \nabout. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I think so.  I -- I \nwholeheartedly agree with you. \nMR. STIRPE:  Okay.  Thank you.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Thank you. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n290ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Miller. \nMR. MILLER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MILLER:  This I-81 project is going to be a \nmajor undertaking in the Syracuse area which is going to affect \nmotorists from all over the Greater Syracuse area and it's gonna reach \nas far as east as probably well into Madison County and far west into \nour neighboring counties all along that Thruway corridor.  It's not only \ngonna be a congestion problem, it's gonna be a traffic safety problem \nfor a lot of the construction workers.  And this is only going to be a \ntemporary -- temporary halt in -- in tolls.  \nYou know, being somebody who drove that -- that \ncorridor and that area for many years -- I was a sales engineer in my \nprevious life before I came here -- in the Syracuse area primarily and \nwe used all the roads and primarily -- primarily the Thruway corridor \nto get to point A to point B to bypass any construction.  \nBut one of the things I really want to stress is this \nI-81 reconstruction is going to be a major, major reconstruction \nthroughout the Greater Syracuse area, and I really feel this -- this bill \nwill get the motorists off the side roads, make the construction safer, \nmake their -- make their -- their commute quicker, and we'll review it \nafter -- after that's all over.\nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n291Mr. Fitzpatrick.  \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor answer a couple of questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Yes, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Thank you, Mr. Magnarelli.  \nYou mentioned before that the Thruway Authority believes it can \nmeet its obligations I'm assuming to the bondholders because of the \nquestion raised about the bonds.  Are they -- they believe they can \nmeet their obligations, correct?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  That's correct. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  That loss of revenue.  What \nabout the cost of maintenance, repair?  Any labor contracts, any, you \nknow, contracted obligations?  Is it -- those costs, would they suffer \nany possible loss or difficulty if they lost that revenue?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Give me one second. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Not just the bonds. \n(Pause)\nWould that loss of revenue create pressure on their \nother operations?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I -- I don't believe so and \nthat's why we put in the bill the flexibility that we've talked about \nbefore.  If there is any pressure to any extent they can raise the fee for \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n292that pass. \n(Cross-talk)\nMR. FITZPATRICK:  -- for the free transportation --\n(Cross-talk) \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Correct.  From zero to so \nmuch a mile, yeah. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Okay.  So let me ask you, \nrather than passing legislation, they have a board of overseers or a \nBoard of Directors or trustees for the Authority, correct, they have a \nboard. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  There's a board, yes. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  So what is preventing that \nboard from reducing the tolls say to zero for a period of time, because \nmy concern is if we do this legislatively -- you know, every two years \nwe pass extenders for sales tax, hotel/motel tax, et cetera, and, you \nknow, I'm sure there are taxpayers who do pay attention to this and \nthey hope each every two years that those taxes will some day \ndisappear, but we all know that once a tax is imposed it never \ndisappears.  Well, the same will happen with something that's free.  So \nfive years from now when if you're still here or if your successor say \nin five years says, geez, this five year gift is now over , I'm under \ntremendous pressure to extend this benefit for another two , four, five \nyears, that's going to happen.  And that's when you're going to get a \nrush from all the other areas of the State that  hey, we want this , too.  \nSo that's the fear I have of granting something like this when the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n293Board of Directors, the directors of the authority can do this now \nwithout our intervention.  Why aren't they -- have they considered \nthat, and if they didn't, why not?  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I don't know the answer to \nthat.  I can't speak for them.  And they haven't done it and that's why \nwe're doing it. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  But I -- I would think we \nshould apply maybe some pressure from the Governor, through the \nLegislature to have them ask them first, are you willing to do this, will \nyou do this, we would like you to do this and let's keep our fingers \ncrossed that they do it rather than have us do it because we're going to \ncome under tremendous pressure in five years, either you or your \npredecessor to extend this freebie for another period, just like we do \ntax bills, and now we're going to set a dangerous precedent because \nnow everyone else is going to want that benefit, also.  And we just \nwon't be able to afford that.  \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I think --\nMR. FITZPATRICK:  So I would say let's go back to \nthe drawing board and let's ask the board at the Thruway Authority to \nlower those rates because if they're telling you that we can meet all of \nour obligations, then that raises the question you're overcharging us, \nyou know, throughout the entire system because it's the rest of the \nsystem that's going to pay for the benefit of -- to pay for the benefit of \nthe people in and around Syracuse, and I don't begrudge them that \nbenefit because, you know, the problems involved with this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n294construction project are real, but then again we're asking others to pick \nup the -- the cost when the Thruway Authority is telling the sponsor, \nyou, that we'll have enough money to meet our obligations.  So I'm \nassuming that's the bonds, it's maintenance, repair, et cetera, so they \nhave the ability to do this by themselves already without coming to us. \nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Well, I'm assuming that they \ndo.  I'm not positive that they do.  I'm agreeing with you.  \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Okay.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  But on the other hand, you \nknow, I feel this is the way to do it because it will get done if we pass \nit and the Governor signs it. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  All right.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  I think it's very much needed \nin the area.  I do believe we put enough flexibility in the statute to \nallow the Thruway Authority to meet its needs.  If need be, it could do \nwhat it has to do.  And another thing that, you know, you mentioned \nthat other people are paying for it.  Remember taxpayers don't pay for \nthe Thruway.  It's all tolls, it's all tolls.  And as my colleague across \nthe room there mentioned, these are additional people that really don't \nuse the Thruway on a daily basis, and that's what we're trying to get at.  \nSo the amounts of revenue that we're talking about I don't -- I think I \nmay have misspoke when I gave those figures to my colleague over \nhere. (Indicating) I'm not quite sure how much we're going to lose in \nterms of revenues going down.  There's a lot of things that have \nhappened over the last few years including toll increases and other \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n295things.  So I don't think that we're going to be losing significants \namount of revenues.  I believe that the Thruway is going to consider -- \ncontinue to operate meeting all of its bond obligations and \nmaintenance and repair costs as well. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Okay, very good.  Thank you, \nMr. Magnarelli.\nMR. MAGNARELLI:  Thank you.\nMR. FITZPATRICK:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. FITZPATRICK:  I'm very sympathetic to the \nplight of the local residents who would normally travel on local roads, \nbut because of the construction project will be forced to use the -- the \nThruway.  And I'm not necessarily opposed to doing this, but I don't \nthink the Legislature should be passing a bill to accomplish this.  I \nthink discussion, frankly, whoever appoints those trustees to the \nThruway Authority, whether it's the Governor or the Legislature, \nwhoever it is should apply or have a conversation with that Thruway \nAuthority and get them to either lower those toll rates and do that \ninternally without coming to the Legislature, because my real fear is \nonce a benefit is granted, it is very difficult to rescind.  And there will \nbe tremendous pressure after five years of traveling that roadway for \nfree to now have to go back and pay to use it.  So just as we extend \ntaxes every two years, we're going to start extending benefits every \ntwo or five years and that will start to snowball and then we're going \nto have some fiscal difficulties, and then at that point we will have \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n296trouble paying the bonds and meeting those obligations.  What the \nGovernor's veto stated is absolutely correct.  I've worked for many \nyears in the industry selling bonds and there are a lot of widows out \nthere who are depending on that revenue from the bond interest \npayments to meet their obligations.  So if the Thruway Authority can \nafford to meet its obligations as predicted by the sponsor, then they \nshould on their own initiative lower those toll rates and not have us \nenter into that conversation because you set up authorities to insulate \nthem from politics.  We here are not insulated from politics.  So -- and \nthat's why, you know, from a fiscal standpoint we're in so much \ntrouble in many regards.  \nSo for that reason I -- unfortunately I'm not going to \nbe able to support this bill.

We are going to continue on our debate list and start with \nRules Report No. 570 by Mr. Weprin, Rules Report No. 587 by Ms. \nSolages, Rules Report No. 593 by Ms. Bichotte Hermelyn, Rules \nReport No. 617 by Mr. Wieder and Rules Report No. 639 by Ms. \nRosenthal.  In that order, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nPage 15, Rules Report No. 570, the Clerk will read.\nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A06576-B, Rules \nReport No. 570, Weprin, Anderson, Alvarez, Cruz, Jackson, De Los \nSantos, Rivera, Tapia, Cunningham, Meeks, Berger, Torres, Wright, \nDais, Taylor, Reyes, Lucas, Kay.  An act to amend the General \nBusiness Law and the Insurance Law, in relation to requiring \npeer-to-peer car sharing programs provide certain insurance coverage.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Mr. \nWeprin, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n298advanced.  \nAn explanation has been requested. \nMr. Weprin.\nMR. WEPRIN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  This \nbill amends sections 901 and 905 of the General Business Law and \nSection 2131 of the Insurance Law, to require peer-to-peer car sharing \nplatforms to provide three times the State mandated insurance \nminimums in -- in lieu of the current 1.25 million.  The bill also \nrequires peer-to-peer car sharing platforms to offer consumers access \nto higher levels of coverage by providing them the option to purchase \nsupplemental liability insurance for SLI.  Finally, this bill would make \nit so that peer-to-peer car sharing platforms must adequately disclose \nthe coverage available to consumers.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Jensen.  \nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you very much, Madam \nSpeaker.  Will my friend, the Chairman of the Insurance Committee \nand the gentleman from Queens, yield for some questions on this very \nimportant topic?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  I'd be happy to. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Weprin.  I -- I \nappreciate you yielding.  So, currently in New York State, how many \nof these peer-to-peer car sharing companies are currently licensed to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n299operate?\nMR. WEPRIN:  There's really only one at this point.  \nThere was a company called Getaround and they left the market \nbecause of that additional 1.25 million coverage that was not required \nin any other state of the 50 states.  So, the current company is called \nTuro. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  So, this legislation and -- and \nper your explanation, currently peer-to-peer car sharing, this one \ncompany Turo, they're required to have $1.25 million of coverage for \neach of the vehicles currently part of the program, correct?\nMR. WEPRIN:  Correct. \nMR. JENSEN:  And your proposal is taking it down \nto three times the minimum.  So, the minimum coverage per vehicle is \n25,000, correct?  And we're -- we're bringing them up to have a \nminimum of 75,000 per vehicle?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, it's actually -- it'll be 75-, 150- \nand 30-.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  So, if -- let's say for instance, \nthat somebody who's utilizing this platform, I image it's done through \nan app, but they're utilizing this program and a -- a driver hits a -- a \nchild pedestrian, say suffers brain trauma after being struck by a \nvehicle that's part of this program.  What would their maximum \nrecovery be under this legislation?\nMR. WEPRIN:  A bodily injury would be 75- .\nMR. JENSEN:  So, it would be 7,500 to cover the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n300lifetime of medical care, rehabilitation and support, in this example, \nfor a child that would've sustained a traumatic brain injury from an \naccident caused by an operator of one of these vehicles?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  It was 75,000, but I want to point out \nthat even at three times the minimum, New York State will be the \nhighest minimum for this type of operation than all other 50 states.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay, but it's still only a minimum of \n$75,000 for any personal injury that is caused through negligent \noperation of a vehicle that is procured through this peer-to-peer car \nsharing mechanism.  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yes, except as I pointed out earlier \nwhen I was explaining the bill, you can -- you can obtain additional \ninsurance on your own as -- as part of this program. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  So, my understanding is that \npeer-to-peer ride-sharing, car-sharing is -- is considered a risky \nendeavor, and it's so risky in the -- in fact, that some credit card \ncompanies, I think a great deal, are specifically excluding them from \ncoverage under their model.  And with the example that's licensed in \nthe State, being a place for sometimes inexperienced, sometimes \nyoung drivers and sometimes maybe cars that should go faster than \nthey ought to, wouldn't reducing the insurance requirements without \ndata on accidents and criminal activity be premature?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Not really.  Again, we're only -- \nwe're reducing it to maintain a market in New York State.  As I \npointed out, there was one other company, Getaround, which left New \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n301York because of that 1.25 million and there are 49 other states that \nhave less than three times the minimum.  So, we -- with this statute, if \n-- if we pass it, will still be the highest minimum for this type of \nservice in the United States. \nMR. JENSEN:  But wouldn't it make sense to do part \nof a larger study, you know, whether by DFS or another agency, on \nthe use of this platform for incidences where the operator of these \nvehicles through this system may be utilizing the way that we have \nhigher than expected rates of personal injury, accidents, criminal \nactivity, as opposed to going through more of the traditional rental \nmodels?  Wouldn't it make more sense to -- to find out whether or not \nthere is a higher level of inherit need for higher coverage?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, we've had this opportunity to \nhave the peer-to-peer car sharing only since 2021.  We were actually \nthe last State to enact this and it's worked very successfully in -- in 49 \nstates.  \nMR. JENSEN:  So -- so, in that respect and -- and I'm \nglad you brought up the fact that the -- it's only been in operation for \nless than five years.  Didn't when this Legislature that you and I are \nboth a part of and a great many of our colleagues who are currently \nvoting on this bill, approve it, didn't we approve it with the \nunderstanding that the coverage, the maximum -- or the mandatory \ncoverage liability that would have to be carried would be 1.25 \nmillion?  Why after four years we thought that that was an important \ncoverage mandate, we're now reducing it so drastically?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n302MR. WEPRIN:  Well, because it's been in operation, \nas you pointed out, for about five years and it's been a success and it's \nbeen a success in 49 other states and we don't want New York \nconsumers to not have this option and there are plenty of peer-to-peer \ndrivers that are earning additional income for New Yorkers, especially \nin a tough economy.  So, we -- we believe it -- it's working and we \nwould still have the highest minimum of any other state. \nMR. JENSEN:  And I think, certainly, you know, \ncertainly I think in a -- in a bipartisan way, we all want to see \ncompanies succeeding and the -- the loan company that is licensed to \noperate in New York has over a billion dollars in increased revenue.  \nWouldn't we want them insuring that if negligent operation of their \nservice leads to a traumatic injury, a personal injury, that the \nparticipants in the program have the necessary coverage liability \namount to ensure that if a New Yorker, either a permanent resident or \na visitor to our State, is -- is harmed through this program, that they \nhave -- they can be ensured that they're taken care of?  Why are we -- \nwhy are we looking to reduce it for a company that's increased over a \nbillion dollars in revenue since coming to the State?\nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, there's also been a lot of \nrevenue to New York State, a significant amount during that period.  \nBut it's still regulated by the Department of Financial Services and the \nDepartment of Financial Services can do a study, but right now, we \nwould be -- we are the 50th State and as I pointed out, we still even \nwith this change, will have the highest minimum.  We would -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n303actually, we'd be tied with Oregon.  \n(Cross-talk)\nMR. JENSEN:  See, so now you -- now you've been \ntelling me fibs this entire time.  You didn't say we'd be tied with \nOregon.  Classical, Oregon.  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yeah, we're tied with Oregon. \nMR. JENSEN:  All right.  And -- and for -- for the \nrecord, Mr. Weprin, you may say that New York is the 50th State, it's \nnumber one in my heart.  So, I -- I appreciate that -- that note. \nYou mentioned that DFS could do a study. \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yes. \nMR. JENSEN:  One, why haven't they done a study?  \nAnd two, what does DFS have to say about this piece of legislation?\n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  Yeah.  DFS does not object to it, we \nactually worked with DFS to allow for the supplementary -- \nsupplemental insurance, SLI.  So DFS has been involved in this \nprocess and they -- they're not opposed to legislation.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Mr. Weprin, would you \nclassify Turo or a peer-to-peer car-sharing service -- would you \nclassify that as a ride-sharing company?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  No, it's not considered a ride sharing \ncompany, it's probably more akin to a car rental.\nMR. JENSEN:  Oh, I thought I was going to get you, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n304that was good -- that was good work.  I -- I would say it is -- it's \nsomewhere in the middle ground, which I guess based on the 100- --  \nor $75,000 new minimum, would put them right in the middle of a \ntraditional car rental service and with the ride-hailing services, like \nLift or Uber, #nofreeads.  But, wouldn't this because you're utilizing \nsomebody else's personal property rather than corporate property, \nwouldn't that make this much more similar to ride-sharing apps than \nthe traditional rental model?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  I would say not and with the ride- \nshare, the liability is greater because of passengers. \nMR. JENSEN:  Well, if I'm renting a car through this \nmechanism, couldn't I possibly have passengers, also?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  You could, but that, you know, that's \nnot generally, you know, the situation.\nMR. JENSEN:  Because I would imagine somebody \nwould utilize this mechanism if somebody lives in a massive urban \ncenter, may utilize public transportation for all their \"get about \ntowns\", but then, you know, may want to visit our beautiful Catskills, \nor the Finger Lakes Wine Trail, they would have to rent a vehicle and \nthey may rent through this service and they may not be going by \nthemselves.  They'd be going with maybe their family, maybe their \nfriends, maybe it's a bachelor party, we don't know.  Wouldn't then \nthere be increased liability that would necessitate a higher coverage \nlimit than something on par with the traditional rental car and more \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n305like a -- a ride-sharing app?\n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  Actually, a car rental is a -- is less \nminimum insurance required. \nMR. JENSEN:  No, a car sharing app is more.  It's \n150,000.  \nMR. WEPRIN:  No, I'm saying a traditional rental \ntruck. \nMR. JENSEN:  Yes.  Okay.  \nMR. WEPRIN:  But you were comparing it to a \ntraditional rental -- \nMR. JENSEN:  Yeah, and I'm -- I'm saying there'd be \na higher -- they should have a higher burden because they're utilizing \nit as a personal vehicle for a personal mechanism rather than just a \ntraditional maybe one or two day jaunt that a rental company would \ntraditionally look for. \nWhat distinguishes the Turo business model that \nwould justify an exemption from the traditional consumer protections \nthat exist?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  It's the -- it's the peer-to-peer \noperation which operates in 49 states and you know, Turo, at this \npoint, is the only company doing that, as I mentioned, because of the \nother company that was here that left the business specifically because \nof that 1.25 million get-around. \nMR. JENSEN:  All right.  So, in the hypothetical I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n306lead off this debate with where a pedestrian is struck, suffers traumatic \npersonal injury, the $75,000 coverage liability would not be enough to \n-- to cover the cost of care.  Where would the burden fall on \nunderwriting the rest of that individual's healthcare needs?  Would it \nbe Medicaid?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, that's why we're offering the \nsupplemental liability insurance. \nMR. JENSEN:  But it's not -- but it's not a mandatory \npurchase, it's supplemental.  So, either --\nMR. WEPRIN:  But it would up -- be up to the \nindividual person who's -- who's in the business to decide that.  If they \nwant a supplemental insurance, they can get it.  Otherwise, not.\nMR. JENSEN:  So, my belief then if through a \nnegligent operation of one of these vehicles, somebody suffers a -- a \ntraumatic injury, a personal injury, either it's going to be Medicaid's \nresponsibility to come up with the care to coverage for it.  It's going to \nbe their private insurance, which would also increase costs on \neverybody else in the private insurance marketplace, or it would be \nout of the pocket.  Would it be out of the pocket of the operator of the \nvehicle, or would it the owner of the vehicle, or would it be Turo \nitself?  Who -- who am I suing?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  It would be Turo itself.\nMR. JENSEN:  Turo itself.  So, I wouldn't sue the \noperator of the vehicle, I wouldn't sue the owner of the vehicle who \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n307participated in the program, it would be Turo itself?\nMR. WEPRIN:  Right, but many lawyers sue \neverybody.\nMR. JENSEN:  Well, I'm not a lawyer.  I think we \nhave a few of them here.  I, you know, they may have thoughts on \nthat.  \nCertainly, is there a portion of the business model of \nthis company that reduces the coverage that they provide for \nparticipants in the program based on the vehicle they actually have?  \nSo, a late model, two-door sedan may require less coverage than a \nWagoneer, which is a luxury SUV.  Doesn't the business model make \na differentiation on the type of vehicle when it comes to what kind of \ncoverage they have to pay and if whether or not supplemental \ninsurance would be required or would remain optional? \nMR. WEPRIN:  It -- it does not.  It would be the \nsame.\nMR. JENSEN:  It doesn't have -- it doesn't have a \npremium protection model as part of its business model?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  No.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. \nWeprin.  I appreciate the answers to your questions.  \nMr. Speaker, on the bill.  \nACTING SPEAKER JONES:  On the bill.\nMR. JENSEN:  Certainly I -- I appreciate Chairman \nWeprin answering my questions and -- and this is certainly a service \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n308that -- that I have not had the privilege to utilize and certainly is \nsomething that is very different than what exists in the current model.  \nCertainly when we talk about the use of cars for other people's use, \nyou know, the -- the -- the big three are traditional rental car services.  \nUnder the State's law they have a $50,000 coverage amount per \naccident.  Ride-hailing or ride-sharing companies, they do have \n$150,000 per accident coverage amount and then delivery services \nthat utilize cars or other forms of transit also have a $150,000 per \naccident coverage amount.  While the Legislature in 2021 approving \nthis type of service in the State saw fit to mandate a $1.25 million \ncoverage amount, we've seen unfortunately that sometimes the \noperators and the utilizers of this type of service do not always have \nthe best intentions.  They may not be using it to get from point A, or -- \nor point B, but they may be utilizing it for means that are not \nnecessarily the -- the safest for other people utilizing the road, whether \nin their own vehicles or on pedestrians.  Certainly moving forward \nwith this legislation, before the -- the Division of Financial Services \nhave done a true study into the utilization of these types of services in \nNew York, the accident data as it relates to your operation, the study \nof any and all criminal acts be utilized while this service is being used \nbefore -- without having that happen before we reduce the coverage \namount mandate, I think is concerning.  Only four years ago we saw \nfit to -- to mandate a higher amount.  And you know, certainly I'm not \nthe -- the part of the State that's utilizing this, but certainly hearing \nfrom -- from people who do live in that part of the State who -- who \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n309utilize it quite often, there are concerns and I think those concerns \nshow that we need more study [sic] before we proceed.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER JONES:  Mr. Ra.\nMR. RA:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yes. \nMR. RA:  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER JONES:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. RA:  So, can you just -- because you said the -- \nthe comparable thing even though the amounts under this would differ \na little bit, but the comparable situation would be a traditional rental \ncar.  But -- so, how does this business model work in terms of some of \nthose things that we're familiar with with a rental car?  First of all, age \nrestrictions.  Do they have the same age restrictions with these type of \nride-sharing -- ride -- what do you call it?  A peer-to-peer --  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Peer-to-peer.\nMR. RA:  -- situation?  Do they -- do they also \nrequire many -- many insurance -- or rental car companies require the \nperson be at least 21 and -- and many times there's an additional \ncharge if they're under 25 years old.  At what age can you utilize one \nof these peer-to-peer networks to -- to rent a vehicle?\nMR. WEPRIN:  Yeah, the -- it would be 18 year -- \nyears old, but it wouldn't be a higher restriction. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So, I mean, that to me is one \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n310concern because I think as we all know the young -- there's a reason \nfor this and that's that younger drivers tend to be less experienced \ndrivers and there's a greater danger.  The other thing is, how does a -- \nhow does -- how do these peer-to-peer companies deal with really just \nassessing a vehicle that's being used in terms of; that it's safe, that it's \ntires have good tread on it, that it's brakes are, you know, functional.  \nThey are -- do they -- they inspect, or is the person who wants to list \ntheir vehicle to be able to be shared through one of these companies \nrequired to do anything to prove that the car is in good, safe working \ncondition?\n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, you still have to pass New \nYork State inspection laws and, you know, car rentals as well don't \ndifferentiate often between various models. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  Thank you.  And then, just with \nregard to this -- this change monetarily, I understand what you're \nsaying in terms of it being a higher minimum than other states have \nbut, you know, given that it wasn't that long ago that we put this \nhigher amount.  I mean, why such a drastic reduction from 1.25 \nmillion all the way down to, you know, at most, 150,000?  That -- that \nseems like a very big jump, and as my colleague said, that is a very \nsmall amount of money if somebody were to have a serious injury as a \nresult of a -- a crash in one of these vehicles. \nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, the problem is the -- the same \nit is -- as it is throughout the country in all 50 states.  None of the 50 \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n311states besides New York currently have that $1.25 million minimum \nrequirement in addition to anything else and it's not working by the \nfact that there's only one company left and other companies have not \ncome into the market.  And as I mentioned, the -- the only other \ncompany that was active in this five-year period was Getaround, \nwhich left the market specifically citing that additional 1.25 million. \nMR. RA:  Are you suggesting that companies if it \ngets too expensive to operate in New York leave?  That's a rhetorical \nquestion.\nMr. Speaker, on the bill.\nMR. WEPRIN:  I think you've -- I think you've -- I \nthink you've raised it a few times in the past. \nACTING SPEAKER JONES:  On the bill.\nMR. RA:  So, my concern here is that is a big jump \nand the supplemental side of it, I think when you put the -- these two \ntogether, it provides some level of security that if there is a -- a really \nbad accident, that there's going to be some coverage, some ability for \njustice for an individual who has been seriously injured.  This \nminimum amount is -- is not going to do much when you have a -- a \nreally serious injury.  So, I -- I just want to reiterate, while certainly I \nappreciate the idea of trying to make it easier for businesses to \noperate, as the sponsor said, I talk about that often on this floor and it's \nsomething we need to look at in so many different areas, but I don't \nknow that an area where we're talking about making sure there's \nadequate coverage when a unvetted, probably, driver is going to be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n312driving a vehicle that the company hasn't looked at, doesn't know if \nthe brakes are good, doesn't know if the tires have good tread on them, \ndoesn't know if the headlights are working, doesn't know if the seat \nbelts are working.  All of those types of things, there is the potential \nfor a serious accident and insurance is based upon risk and I think, \nclearly, there's a greater risk with regard to a situation where \nsomebody is driving one of these vehicles.\nSo, that's my concern with this.  I -- I think we could \ntry to address this issue without having such a drastic reduction in the \namount of required insurance coverage.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER JONES:  Mr. Durso. \nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Would the \nsponsor yield for some questions?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yes, I will.\nACTING SPEAKER JONES:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nThe sponsor yields.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Mr. Weprin.  So and -- \nand this may have already been answered, but I'm just a little confused \non this.  So, the original -- or prior to this bill, it was 1.25 million for \ntheir insurance to be placed on a peer--to--peer program?\nMR. WEPRIN:  That's correct. \nMR. DURSO:  Why was it at 1.25 million to begin \nwith?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, if -- if you ask Turo, it was an \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n313unreasonable amount for a company trying to get into the market and \nit -- the -- our experience has been that that's prevented the market \nfrom expanding.  And as a matter of fact, Turo's other major \ncompetitor has actually left the market specifically citing that -- that \namount. \nMR. DURSO:  So, who made the decision or who \nmakes up the fact that there needed to be $1.25 million?\nMR. WEPRIN:  That was actually before I was \nInsurance Chair, but I guess it was (conferencing) -- I'm told it was \npart of an overall negotiation and I'm sure DFS was involved.  But, as \nI said before, DFS does not object to this legislation and we've had \nthat discussion with them. \nMR. DURSO:  Understood, but, again and -- and not \nbeing an insurance person, but who would sit there and -- and be in \nthat discussion other than DFS to decide on that $1.25 million amount \nof coverage?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  It could be, you know, I -- I don't \nknow, but there's --  \nMR. DURSO:  Well, did we -- did we legislate it \nhere?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yeah, it was part of -- part of the \nlegislation in New York State in the Legislature. \nMR. DURSO:  So -- so, they negotiated it and now \nwe need to change it and they agree with the change?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Correct. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n314MR. DURSO:  That -- well, that's my question.  I'm \ntrying to understand and I'm not trying to be difficult.  Why now?  Is it \nbecause another company went out of business, moved out of state, \ncouldn't afford the premiums?\nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, also we -- we have not had \nadditional companies entering the market. \nMR. DURSO:  How is this company that's still in \nbusiness doing financially?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, they -- they've threatened to \nleave the market if it -- if we maintained it, but how do they do it?  I \ndon't know, but -- \nMR. DURSO:  No, I'm saying are they doing \nfinancially well?  They're still in business?\nMR. WEPRIN:  They're still in business. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So, I mean, obviously I'm -- \nI'm -- \nMR. WEPRIN:  I'm told that they're losing money in \nNew York.  They're -- they operate in all 50 states --\nMR. DURSO:  Okay. \nMR. WEPRIN:  -- so they're much more profitable in \nother states other than New York, because they do not have this \nadditional requirement. \nMR. DURSO:  Understood.  So, what is the -- what is \nthe minimum for me, as a driver, to have on my car insurance?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  If this legislation passes, it would be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n31575,000.  \nMR. DURSO:  No, no, no.  I'm saying me as a person \n-- my personal car.  What -- what is the minimum in New York State \nto have on your car as -- \nMR. WEPRIN:  25,000. \nMR. DURSO:  25,000.  And that would be --\nMR. WEPRIN:  A third -- a third of what we're \nasking on this.\nMR. DURSO:  A third -- \nMR. WEPRIN:  The minimum for -- \nMR. DURSO:  What's the minimum going to be on \nthis for this ride-share?  Thank you.\nMR. WEPRIN:  It would be 75,000.\nMR. DURSO:  So, but the minimum for a personal \ndriver would be 25,000?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Correct. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  But now this is still a business.  \nSo, this is -- and you're saying this is making it even with car rentals, \ncorrect?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  It's -- it's more than the car rentals \nI'm told.   \nMR. DURSO:  It's still more than -- \nMR. WEPRIN:  Still more than the car rentals, yes.\nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n316MR. WEPRIN:  Three times more, because the car \nrental doesn't comply with the minimum requirement in New York \nState. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So -- so, a car rental only has \nto require with the -- go with the minimum in New York State?  This \nis saying that even after this legislation, the peer-to-peer program, car \nrentals would still be more than a traditional car rental?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yes, three times more, tied with \nOregon, more than -- than the other 48 states. \nMR. DURSO:  So now if I go rent a car myself from \na -- a traditional car rental company, does my personal car insurance, \nif I have personal car insurance if I own a car, but I'm renting a car, \ndoes my car insurance coverage cover if there's any accidents while \nI'm driving that car?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Yeah, for personal auto the answer is \nyes. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  And would it be the same on \nthe peer-to-peer rentals?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Not necessarily. \nMR. DURSO:  Not -- so, what -- can you explain \nthat?  So, if I go rent a car and I have car insurance for my personal \nvehicle, does my car insurance that I paid for on my Jeep then cover \nme in any way, shape, or form on a car rental if it's from a traditional \ncar rental company?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  I -- I believe it would. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n317MR. DURSO:  Okay.  It does.  So, would it -- would \nmy personal car insurance cover me on a peer-to-peer car rental?  If \nyou want to call it a car rental. \nMR. WEPRIN:  I believe it probably would, but I \nmean it would be up to, I guess, the individual insurance company. \nMR. DURSO:  The individual insurance company \nthat I have my personal car insurance with, or that the whether it's \nrental company, or peer-to-peer car program, has their insurance with?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  It probably should be the same, you \nknow, as if you're have -- you're having your car and -- and you're \nasking for your insurance, you know, to cover it.\nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So, as my colleague was \ngetting at also, with a traditional car company you can rent it on line, \nyou can do whatever.  But, then you generally, probably 90 percent of \nthe time, you're ending up, whether it's at the airport or somewhere \nelse, going to pick up that car at a brick-and-mortar type facility, \ncorrect?  Where they check your license, they can check your \ninsurance, you can add insurance.  How does that work with the \npeer-to-peer program?  Because from the way I'm looking at it and \nagain, this is all new to me, it's strictly online.  \nMR. WEPRIN:  It's -- it's done through an app, yes. \nMR. DURSO:  So, how does the app check your \nlicense, your insurance, your age, anything like that?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  It's a new world since -- since I, you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n318know, started here, but obviously there are ways that apps do that and, \nyou know, it's built in -- into the app, you know, to ask those questions \nand make to that identity determination.\nMR. DURSO:  My -- my concern with it, again, is \nthat we're lowering the amount of insurance and coverage that a \npeer-to-peer program -- peer-to-peer car rental has when it's strictly on \nline and there's not that, for lack of a better word, brick-and-mortar \nstore where you go in and get your license checked, see your age as \nmy colleague said, see if you have other insurance.  So, there is the \npossibility for some kind of fraud, right, to where people are renting \nvehicles that don't either have proper insurance, an up-to-date license, \na non-suspended license, anything like that, to where the liability for \nthat peer-to-peer and/or that driver could be much higher.  So, don't \nyou think in that case, with the possibility of fraud and not being able \nto check that and not seeing if that person has accidents or a \nsuspended license, that having the higher insurance premium for those \nvehicles would be the smarter idea to protect everybody else that's out \non the street?\nMR. WEPRIN:  I don't think so, because there are 49 \nother states, 48 if you take out Oregon and it seems to be working.  It's \na relatively new concept in the country and it's certainly even newer in \nNew York State, only since 2020 -- since 2021.  So, it seems to be \nworking across the country and this is another option for New York \ndrivers.  We don't want to put them at a competitive disadvantage to \nother states.  I've heard that many times from your side of the aisle. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n319MR. DURSO:  But who are we putting at a \ncompetitive disadvantage, other companies from coming in?\nMR. WEPRIN:  Other companies from coming in or \nindividual people that want to access this peer-to-peer company.\nMR. DURSO:  Where are these peer-to-peer \ncompanies or this particular company operate out of?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  Turo? \nMR. DURSO:  Yes.  And -- and it's not even -- where \nis their biggest area that we know of that they operate from?  Where is \ntheir biggest rental area, peer-to-peer program area where they would \nbe used?  \nMR. WEPRIN:  I don't know for sure, but I know \nthey're very active in New York State.  And they -- \nMR. DURSO:  I hope so, this is for -- this is for New \nYork State.  I hope they're active here.  But I'm saying do you think it's \nin the City, do you think it's in the suburbs, do you think it's Upstate \nNew York, more rural areas?  What -- what do we think because, \nagain, my concern is if a peer-top-peer car rental where we're \nlowering the premium and the amount of insurance that you have to \nhave to protect not only that driver, but other drivers and pedestrians \nout on the road in busier areas where they can't really check if \nsomeone has a proper license, is the proper age, has proper insurance, \nor what their driving history is.  Don't you think we should have \nhigher insurance on vehicles like that to protect all of us?  We don't \nknow who's driving these cars and -- and the people that are renting \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n320them don't know who's driving them either. \nMR. WEPRIN:  Well, I'm told that there's not any \nmore of a risk for those type of fraudulent activities than -- than a \nrental car and the experience has been that it has not been a problem \nfor Turo and -- and -- and they have very high verification procedures \nin place. \nMR. DURSO:  I'm sure Turo is saying it's not a \nproblem because then we would obviously make their insurance \npremium higher.  But as the Chair on Insurance and as an insurance \nprofessional, do you think that it is possible in this type of situation, \nwith this type of company, which is not that brick-and-mortar store \nwhere you can check that license, check insurance, any type of \nbackground, filling out paperwork in front of somebody, knowing \nwho's actually renting that car and again, as my colleague said, who \nelse is getting in the car?  We don't know who else is going to be \ndriving it, you can be renting a truck with six people in it.  Again, \nhaving $25,000 insurance or $50,000 insurance is not nearly enough if \nGod forbid there's a catastrophic accident.  So, again, in busier areas \nand not knowing who's diving the car or if that company's taking care \nof that car, as my colleague said.  There's tread on the tires, brakes \nchecked, inspection done, windows tinted, anything -- you know, \nexhaust, anything on that car that is -- we don't know how it's \noperating, who's checking it and who's doing the maintenance on it, \nright?  It's just a peer-to-peer program.  Anybody can join it, anybody \ncan be involved with it and anybody can rent those cars.  Again, we're \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n321putting, unfortunately, the public more at risk.  Again, not saying \nwe're trying to stop businesses from coming in, we just don't know \nwho's taking the cars out.  We don't know who's driving them and in \nwhat manner they're driving.  Wouldn't it be smarter to have that \nhigher insurance on that car to protect all of us from a company that \nright now has a monopoly on it and is probably making pretty good \nmoney.  If they could afford it and as you said we've heard more and \nmore again, this is a corporation, this is a company.  So, we're giving a \ncompany, a large corporation that's making probably millions of \ndollars, a bigger -- billions of dollars, a bigger break, when it's \nactually putting everyone else in here at risk if God forbid there's a \ncatastrophic accident. \n(Conferencing)\nMR. WEPRIN:  Okay.  Well, you know, the original \nbill just removed the 1.25 million.  So, requiring three times the -- and \nwhich would mean if we removed it legislatively, it would mean \nthey'd be subject to the minimum requirement as any other driver in \nNew York State, which would have been a third of what -- what we're \nrequiring.  So, you know, my understanding is that that's not a \nproblem and even three times the minimum is higher than -- than any \nother state except Oregon.  So, it hasn't been a problem in the other 48 \nstates.  We don't expect it to be a problem in New York State.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Mr. Weprin.  I appreciate \nyou answering my questions.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n322ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Chang.\nMR. CHANG:  Thank you very much.  \nOn the bill itself.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. CHANG:  Okay.  So, if, you know, I'm not an \ninsurance person and I'm not a -- a lawyer of any stretch imagination, \nbut I'm looking at this insurance is auto, the insurance generally \nfollows the vehicle rather than the person itself, generally if you \nborrow a car or something like that.  And if there's only one insurance \ncompany in the market, they're literally a monopoly itself.  They can \ncharge whatever premium to (indiscernible) because they have no \nother choice.  So -- or -- or else they'd be out of business.  So, by \nlowering the -- the premiums, also lowering profit opportunities \nbecause then you allow other companies to compete, but you're \ntalking about drastic premium differences.  That's like more than 50 \npercent for a 125- to 75,000.  It's a -- that's why it defies the logic \nitself on -- on why we're decreasing the coverage itself, just to \nincrease more insurance into insurance pool?\nSo, I understand trying to lower the premium and \nmake the business survive is one thing, but insurance is different.  It's \na different product.  Insurance is protecting the lives and perhaps the \nvehicle damage itself, but protecting the lives who are driving the -- \nthe vehicle.  So, you know, we have to look at this a little bit \ndifferently.  125 -- 125 million, it's -- it's -- there's a reason behind that  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n323and we're the highest, but at the same time is, the people who got hurt \nutilizing insurance was 125- is enough to cover, in most cases, \nmedical insurance or claims, but when you lower it, you may not be \nenough to cover.  So, that's why I don't understand why -- why we are \nlowering it so much.  If you cut down half, is one thing, but this is a \nmore than half of the liability.  And I would vote no on this -- on this \nbill.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect on the 180th \nday. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS.

STECK:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I -- I \nwas a no in the Insurance Committee on this because a certain aspect \nwas unable to be explained, and that is the liability of the owner of the \nvehicle.  And subsequent to that, while I never got my question \nanswered, I did my own research and what I found is that the statute \nas it exists provides that the company, Turo in this case, would have to \ndefend and indemnify the owner of the vehicle against any lawsuit that \nmight be brought against the owner arising of an accident.  So there is \na protection for the owner.  It would probably be better if the law \nrequired the owner to be named as an additional insured on the Turo \npolicy, because if the company went out of business there would have \nbeen no one there to defend and indemnify the owner.\nI am gonna vote in favor of the bill because there are \nsafeguards in place, but we may have to do a better job as we go down \nthe road to protect people in this situation.  As the Chair indicated, it \nis a new field and experience will tell what's needed. \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Steck in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Blumencranz to explain his vote. \nMR.

It's not \noften that we see a rectifying of a policy put in place that continues to \nhurt both businesses that hope to operate in the State of New York, \nbut also see an ongoing negotiation leading to a piece of legislation \nthat allows for alternative forms of transportation that help small \nbusinesses, that help communities that don't have the same transit \nother communities have, and to help businesses survive in an \nincreasingly difficult insurance environment here in New York State.\nSo I'll be in support of this legislation and I thank the \nsponsor for introducing it and getting it passed.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Blumencranz in \nthe affirmative.\nMr. Jensen to explain his vote. \nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, to \nexplain my vote.  And certainly I want to commend my not previous, \nbut before the previous speaker on his explanation because that was a \nvery good point and it makes me even more insistent on voting no. \nBut I think at the end of the day one of the things that concerns me the \nmost is that both the company that the sponsor and I discussed and the \none that no longer operates here, they negotiated as part of being able \nto operate in the State that $1.25 million number.  The company that \noperates in the State and makes $1 billion in profits.  It's protecting the \nindividuals who utilize the service, the people who share the roads \nwith the individuals who utilize the service and the people who own \nthe cars.  I think that changing a negotiated agreement that they were \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n326perfectly content with to be able to operate in New York State only \nfour years after it was approved without any sort of study into whether \nor not there needs to be a higher limit shows that we are doing this \nprematurely, and I will be voting in the negative.\nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Jensen in the \nnegative.\nMr. Sempolinski to his vote. \nMR.

This bill \nwould codify the disparate impact standard for employment \ndiscrimination cases under the New York State Human Rights Law, \nensuring that the continued protection New Yorkers disparate in -- \nimpact comes under attack through the administrative process and \nlitigation.  It ensures that New York's employment discrimination law \nclearly incorporates the disparate impact standard, protecting workers \nfrom systematic practices that dis -- disproportionately harm protected \ngroups even without explicit intent.  It reflects longstanding federal \nlegal standards under Title VII, and provides fair, transparent rules for \nboth employers and employees.  Codifying this standard eliminates \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n328ambiguity and ensures access to justice for the New Yorkers affected \nby discriminatory policies in the workplace. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh.\nMS.

WALSH:  Thank you very much.  So, it's -- it's \nbeen a while for me to actually take an employment discrimination \ncase.  It's been a couple of years for me.  But from what I remember, it \nused to be that you could either file -- or you could concurrently file \nwith EEOC and the Division of Human Rights, and then you could \neither then bring your case in State court or you could bring your case \nin federal court or you could leave it in the EEOC or the Division of \nHuman Rights to come to a resolution.  And that -- that really hasn't \nchanged, right?  \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  No, it hasn't \nchanged. \nMS. WALSH:  And, in fact, over -- since I was a little \nbaby attorney doing this kind of work, like, 30 years ago, the -- the \nHuman Rights Law has actually gotten beefed up, where it used to be \nthat you could get better remedies before the EEOC or in federal \ncourt, you know, like your attorney's fees, and then that got changed \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n329over time, where now you can get that paid for at -- at the Division of \nHuman Rights or in State court, right?  \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Mm-hmm. \nMS. WALSH:  So, I understand -- we had a similar \ndebate last week with another member about a bill that had to do with \ntrying to ensure that disparate impact was included in housing \ndiscrimination laws. \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Correct. \nMS. WALSH:  So is it fair to say that this bill takes a \nsimilar path, but having to do specifically with the antidiscrimination \nlaws that we have on the books?  \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Yes, it's fair to say \nthat. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And just as that sponsor \nindicated in debate, there was some concern about potential changes \nat the Federal level in the way that it views disparate impact, and \nmaybe a more unfavorable view towards disparate impact theories.  \nBut regardless of what happened at the Federal level, I mean, New \nYork can always opt to do more.  That's -- I -- I mean, I remember \nlearning that in Federal Procedure in law school that Federal law \nestablishes the baseline but that we can always do more at the State \nlevel.  So even if something at the Federal level changes, don't we \nalways have the existing law at the State level?  \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Well, we want to \nmake sure.  I mean, that's why -- I mean, especially during these times \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n330where this Administration has been attacking disparate impact at the \nFederal level through some recent Executive Orders, we want to make \nsure that the State still has the auto -- autonomy to protect people from \nbeing treated dis -- discriminatory.\nMS. WALSH:  Why -- why do you think that \nregardless of what happened at the Federal level that New York's \nautonomy would be in jeopardy?  Because as I said, isn't it already \nvery clear that the State, any state can create its own laws, as we have, \nthat protect disparate impact theory?  \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Well, again we -- \nwe're making sure -- exactly, that's why we're doing this.  We want to \nprotect, just in case that there's some Supreme Court ruling that takes \nanother fundamental right or change the 14th Amendment Equal \nProtection Clause.  We just want to make sure -- or the 5th \nAmendment Protection Clause.  We want to make sure that the State, \nat least the State of the people of New York, are protected. \nMS. WALSH:  But, I mean, hasn't it -- hasn't it been \nestablished for years in New York State that disparate impact can be \nused as a theory?  So a possible basis for claim of unlawful \ndiscrimination could be rooted in the theory of disparate impact \ncommonly used to enforce civil rights where an action or practice, \nwhile appearing neutral on its face, disproportionately affects people \nbased on certain protected immutable characteristics such as race, \ncreed, sex, you know, et cetera. \n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n331MS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Yes.  So you're \ncorrect and that's case law.  So it's -- it's better to put things into \nstatute because it's stronger, and preferably look at statute over \ncommon law. \nMS. WALSH:  I see.  So the -- the concern, then, is \nthat if there are changes or decisional law coming out at the Federal \nlevel, it might negatively impact our established case law in New \nYork State?  \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I \nappreciate your answers to my questions.\nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  So as I said, last week we debated a \nvery similar piece of legislation having to do with, again, reacting to \npossible changes that might happen at the Federal level.  And as I said \nthen, I'll say again that I would say that instead of reacting to \nsomething like a -- a policy statement that is a piece of an Executive \nOrder that was issued along with a million other Executive Orders that \ncame out of the -- the Administration starting, you know, right in -- \nright in January, I think we ought to feel quite secure that in New \nYork State we have embraced and followed a disparate impact theory \nin our decisional case law.  And I don't think that -- I don't think that \nthat's gonna change.  I can appreciate -- I think that this bill and the -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n332the -- the preceding bill last week that we debated both are really \nlooking to -- the term that was used was to \"Trump-proof\" New York.  \nAnd so that's what this bill does.  If you didn't like the one last week, \nyou're -- you're probably for the same reasons not gonna be in favor of \nthis one either. \nYou know, the Presidential Executive Order from \nApril of 2025, it's titled \"Restoring Equality of Opportunity and \nMeritocracy\", and in that the Executive Order sought to reestablish \nwhat he -- with he being the President -- termed a bedrock principle of \nthe United States that people should be guaranteed equal \nopportunities, not equal outcomes, and indicating his desire that it \nshould be the policy of the U.S. to eliminate the use of disparate \nimpact liability.  \nSo whether we actually need to take this step or not \nremains to be seen.  I -- I personally think that we should worry about \nthings that are actually happening and not things that might possibly \nhappen.  Especially as we're dealing with a, you know, a changing \nsituation at the Federal level.\nBut -- so I -- I will be in the negative on this piece of \nlegislation.  I'd encourage my colleagues to do the same, particularly if \nyou felt, as I did about, the bill that we took up last week because this \nis really the same thing, just applying to employment discrimination \nrather than housing.  But -- but I acknowledge that there may be -- \nthere may be a smattering of different votes on this.\nSo thank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n333ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMs. Bichotte Hermelyn. \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  On the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  So this bill clarifies \nthe dis -- disparate impact, clarifies the standard for when a practice \nhas a discriminatory effect, and it provides that an unlawful \ndiscriminatory practice may be established by such practices \ndiscriminatory effect, even if such practices was [sic] not motivated by \na discriminatory intent.  There are two main kinds of employment law \ncases:  Disparate treatment and disparate impact.  Disparate treatment \nrequires proof that the employer was motivated by discrimination, \nwhile disparate impact requires proof that a rule that appears to be \nneutral actually has a disparate impact on members of a protected \nclass. \nNew York has a proud tradition of providing robust \nand expansive antidiscrimination protections, especially in the \nworkplace.  This legislation strengthens that commitment by codifying \ndisparate impact as a form of unlawful discrimination in the \nworkplace under New York State law, as those very protections are \nunder attack by this current Administration.  Disparate impact analysis \nhas long been a key tool for fighting discrimination under Federal law, \ncodified in Title VII.  Disparate analysis -- impact analysis allows a \nplaintiff to argue that practice or conduct is discriminatory, regardless \nof intent, if it has a discriminatory effect.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n334In April 2025th -- 25, the Administration issued an \nExecutive Order dubiously finding disparate impact analysis to be \nunconstitutional.  The Executive Order declared that it is now the \npolicy of the Federal Government to eliminate the use of disparate \nimpact analysis to full extent possible to avoid violating the \nConstitution, Federal Civil Rights Laws and basic American ideals.  \nNever mind that disparate impact is codified in Federal law.  Despite \nthe shaky legal ground, the Administration has moved quickly to end \ncivil rights cases and investigation based on disparate impact analysis.  \nFor example, the Justice Department recently backed out of a consent \nagreement it reached with the Maryland Police Department after \nfinding that the Department had engaged in a discriminatory practice \nby requiring prospective police officers to pass a written test which \nwas not job-specific.  Under this Administration, we are concerned \nthat the Administration appointed judges following the Executive \nOrder will start rolling back these protections.  As a result, all New \nYorkers will be at risk of being shut out of jobs and promotions \nbecause of arbitrary discriminatory and unnecessary rules.  It is, \ntherefore, crucial, crucial to protect employment mobility for all New \nYorkers by passing this bill.  \nAgain, this -- this legislation will codify disparate \nimpact analysis for employment discrimination cases in New York \nState law, ensuring plaintiffs can continue to bring disparate impact \ncases under New York law and affirming our commitment to fighting \ndiscrimination and employment and in our society at-large. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n335Madam Speaker, I will be voting in the affirmative \nand I encourage all my colleagues do so.

It's one that's very important to our State to \nensure that the discriminatory impact, but not necessarily a \ndiscriminatory intent, is considered unlawful.  A labor attorney in my \ndistrict had brought this bill to my attention and was very concerned if \nthis moved forward in the form that we see it now.  And it really \nbalances the need for a fair standard for employers and other entities \nto justify practices that may have disparate impacts but still serve \nlegitimate purposes.\nSo I proudly vote in favor of the measure.  Thank \nyou. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Burdick in the \naffirmative. \nMs. Simon to explain her vote. \nMS. SIMON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I want to \ncommend the -- the sponsor for this legislation.  It's critically needed.  \nAs we speak there are -- there's a proposal to directly change rules that \nhave been adopted through the normal rulemaking process in con -- in \nthe Federal Government.  Those comments on that are due this \nevening.  There's Executive Orders seeking to eliminate disparate -- \ndisparate impact standard.  So it's critically important.  The writing is \non the wall; this is what the Administration intends to do.  If they do it \nthrough the regular rulemaking process they will still be able to make \nsubstantial changes, and they have been looking for years to eliminate \ndisparate impact.  \nSo I think it's very important to protect New Yorkers \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n337(indiscernible) a standard we've been applying in the case law.

An act to amend the Insurance Law, in relation \nto ensuring continued access to backup devices for patients with \ncochlear implants.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Mr. \nWieder, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced. \nAn explanation has been requested.\nMr. Wieder.  \nMR. WIEDER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n338Assembly Bill 6314-A addresses a critical gap in insurance coverage \nfor New Yorkers with cochlear implants.  This bill ensures that \nindividuals who rely on these life-changing devices have guaranteed \naccess to backup processors not only at the initial implementation, but \nthroughout the life of the device, including during necessary upgrades. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gandolfo. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor please yield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. WIEDER:  With pleasure, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you for that.  And we had \nsome discussions on this before this debate.  So, one thing before this \nconversation publicly, you described that this does not apply to the \nentire unit, but rather the processor of the - the implant?  \nMR. WIEDER:  That is correct. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  And typically, why would \na backup unit be necessary -- a backup processor be necessary?  \nMR. WIEDER:  Typically what happens when you \nget a cochlear implant, they would do the implant, which is a very \nexpensive magical device for people who can't hear.  That implant \ngets inserted into the skull for the rest of your life.  However, there's a \nlittle piece, a processor, that it gets connected to that implant and you \nhave to charge that processor.  That processor over the years needs to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n339be upgraded every four to six years and the old one becomes obsolete.  \nInsurance companies would provide two sets of processors at the \ninitial implant because they feel it's essential.  These processors need \nto be charged.  They can malfunction.  They could be lost.  And it's \ncritically important for people to have a backup device.  When we \nneed to charge our phone, you could charge the phone and still use it.  \nYou can't charge the processor and still use that processor. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Oh, okay.  So while the \nprocessor is being charged, the unit is rendered, I guess, useless and \nthe individual would not be able to hear or hear as well as they should \nbe?  \nMR. WIEDER:  That is correct. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Now, typically what -- do \nyou know the cost of a processor out-of-pocket, a backup processor if \nit's not being covered by insurance?  \nMR. WIEDER:  It -- it varies.  The cost could be any \n-- could be 1,500, 2,000, 3,000.  It varies on the -- on the make and \nmodel, and it -- it depends -- for the insurance company, if -- if they \nget a MSRP, you know, on -- on -- on the processor. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  And you mentioned that a \nlot of insurance companies will provide a backup when they originally \ngive it to the -- the patient.  Why do they stop providing the backup if \nthey continue to be rendered obsolete, and I guess the people who \nneed them end up needing another backup?  \nMR. WIEDER:  They -- they do provide a processor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n340to replace the old one.  What they don't provide is a backup processor.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.\nMR. WIEDER:  So you get the implant, you -- you go \nthrough the surgery.  You get two processors, you go home.  You use \nit for five years and then the old one becomes obsolete.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.\nMR. WIEDER:  The insurance company will then go \nand upgrade, but they only give you one processor. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So we -- there's really no \nreason for that.  They just decide after that -- after you get the backup \nprocess -- processor the first time, that's enough.  They just -- I guess \nwhat I'm getting at is, why would you think that the insurance \ncompany doesn't want to provide the backups moving forward?  \nMR. WIEDER:  Your guess is as good as my guess. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Fair enough.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill, please.  And thank you \nto the sponsor for the education on the devices and for answering my \nquestions. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nHere we have another insurance mandate.  And individually, each \nmandate doesn't seem like a lot, but taken as a collective -- we do a lot \nof mandates on insurance companies here, and when you add those all \nup, that really does start to raise the premium costs.  But, however, \nafter our discussion here you can see that not all mandates are created \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n341equal.  Some definitely seem more necessary than others.  But I think \nit shows that we should take a look at some of the other mandates that \nwe do put on the insurance companies that maybe they aren't as \nnecessary and maybe we can keep the costs down so we don't have to \nworry about the cost to providing truly necessary coverage for people \nwho need it; who need it for their development, especially young \nchildren.  If they have to charge this processor, if there is a delay in \ngetting a new processor, they are left without hearing, which just \nshould not be the case.\nSo I do thank the sponsor for answering the questions \nhere.  I'm going to be voting for this bill.  Like I said, this is a -- a \nlapse of coverage here that needs to be addressed. \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Wieder.\nMR. WIEDER:  On the bill.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. WIEDER:  On the bill, Madam Speaker.  \nColleagues, I rise today to urge your support for Assembly Bill \n6314-A, legislation that closes a dangerous and unnecessary gap in \ninsurance coverage for New Yorkers who rely on cochlear implants.\nCochlear implants magically restores hearing for \nindividuals with profound hearing loss.  Many of them children.  But \nlet's be clear.  The surgery itself doesn't restore the hearing.  It's the \nexternal processor, the small wearable device that captures sounds, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n342converts them into digital signals and sends them to the internal \nimplant.  Without the -- that processor, there is no hearing.  No access \nto language.  No communication.  No awareness of sound.  And that \nbrings us to the problem this bill addresses.  Even when the processor \nis working as intended, it still needs to be charged, often daily.  \nDuring charging time, if there is no backup, the user is cut off from \nthe world.  For a child in school that means missing instruction.  For \nan adult at work it means disconnection.  And in any setting it can \nmean missed emergency alarms, traffic sounds or safety warnings.\nWhile some insurance plans provide a backup \nprocessor at the time of the implantation, insurance coverage almost \nnever includes a backup processor when patients receive required \nupgrades every few years.  If that new upgraded processor \nmalfunctions, is lost or is damaged, patients, often children, are left in \ncomplete silence. \nAssembly Bill 6314-A ensures that New Yorkers who \ndepend on cochlear implants have guaranteed coverage for backup \nprocessors not only at the initial implantation, but throughout the life \nof the device, including during necessary upgrades.  We -- we cannot \nallow patients, especially children, to be left without hearing simply \nbecause the processor is charging, malfunctioning or damaged.  This \nbill brings much-needed clarity and protection to a vulnerable \npopulation.  It is a matter of contininity [sic], of care, equity, safety \nand dignity. \nI respectfully ask for your support on this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n343commonsense legislation.  No child, no parent, no New Yorker should \nbe forced into silence because their voices of concerns were unheard \nand their insurance failed to keep pace with their daily realities. \nI will be voting proudly yes and encourage all my \ncolleagues to vote yes.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nRead the last section. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect January 1, \n2027.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote. \n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)  \nAre there any other votes?

MORINELLO:  Thank you.  Is there a definition \nof \"refused.\"?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Um -- \nMR. MORINELLO:  As it -- as it applies to this \nparticular bill. \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I think it's the same \ndefinition as refused would apply to anything else.  They decided not \nto -- not to accept the payment that was offered him for rent owed. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Could that offered payment of \nrent be less than the amount that is due? \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n345MS. ROSENTHAL:  Well, it -- it depends.  It's -- \nERAP covered a certain amount of rent, and I guess that's what -- \nyeah, it would cover -- it covered the amount of rent that was due \nwithin a certain time frame. \nMR. MORINELLO:  So if, in fact, the amount due \nwas greater than the amount that was tendered by the program, would \nthat be grounds to then refuse it?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I don't know what the grounds \nfor refusal would be, particularly when during -- during COVID when \npeople were hurting all over the place and the Federal Government \ngave us funding so that we could pay for people's rents; people who \nwere unemployed, lost their job, and landlords who needed the rent \npaid.  So that was the whole ERAP program.  Some landlords said, I \ndon't want your money, and that was kind of odd.  But that's what this \nbill concerns. \nMR. MORINELLO:  This being your bill, do you \nhave any concept of why or what -- why there would be a refusal to \naccept monies that are due and owing on rent?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I -- you know, if you -- I really \ncannot.  I really cannot conceive of it, especially at a time when \npeople needed -- needed their rent paid.  A refusal to accept it, to me, \nsignaled some kind of other motive. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Okay.  And what would those \nmotives be?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I do not know.  I can't get in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n346head of a landlord who refused to accept money that was guaranteed, \nlike a whole year of rent.  I don't know why someone would refuse it.  \nHowever, there are rules around what happens if a landlord refuses the \nmoney. \nMR. MORINELLO:  During your preparation and \nreview of this bill, did you do any investigating or inquiries of \nlandlords as reasoning for them to refuse? \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  You know, the motive for \nrefusal is immaterial.  This just concerns landlords who did refuse. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Well, you say the motive is to \nrefuse is immaterial.  But there may be a legitimate reason that would \nhold up in a court of law.  So that's why I'm asking, did you do any \ninquiries of landlords as to what reasoning could be for a refusal?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  You know, there could be \nlandlords who didn't like the OTDA guidelines that came with \naccepting the rent.  Some landlords did not want to raise the rent \nbecause there were provisions in it if you accept the money there were \ncertain rules around it. \nMR. MORINELLO:  And one of those rules is they \ncouldn't raise the rent for a year. \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Yup. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Okay.  And how long did this \nprogram go on during COVID?  More than a year?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  The -- the applications closed \non -- let me see what date -- um, January 15th -- January -- sorry, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n347January 20, 2023.  That's when the portal closed. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Okay.  So for a landlord to \naccept that payment, they would have to forgo any increases for a \nyear; am I correct?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Yes. \nMR. MORINELLO:  During that period of time, if \ntaxes increased they could not increase their rent, correct?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Correct. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Okay.  If you --\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  That is -- that is the deal. \nMR. MORINELLO:  If utilities increased, they could \nnot increase their rent. \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  That was the deal. \nMR. MORINELLO:  So is there a possibility the \nlandlord would refuse because they would be losing money over that \nnext period of time, and the inability to either finance their building, \nrepair it or any other reasonings?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  You know, if that were me and I \ngot a whole year's rent, I would accept that. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Well, but if they're living in \nyour premises, wouldn't they be entitled to that rent?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Excuse me?  \nMR. MORINELLO:  Well, you said --\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I can't hear you.  I can't hear \nyou.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n348MR. MORINELLO:  -- you got a whole year's rent, \nyou'd be happy.  Well, if somebody is renting, they're obligated to pay \nthat rent.  So you're making it like this is a gift to a landlord. \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Well, actually it was.  If you \nrecall COVID, people were massively unemployed.  People lost their \njobs.  We all stayed home and we could work remotely.  But there \nwere so many people across the country -- ERAP was a program in \nevery state.  So it's not particular to New York State, and these \nconditions were ones that were similar in other states. \nMR. MORINELLO:  So what about those that just \nwouldn't pay rent?  And there were -- were stories. \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Well, that's not what this bill -- \nif they didn't pay rent, a landlord can go after the rent. \nMR. MORINELLO:  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is, \nduring this period of time there's certain people that just refused to pay \nrent because they wanted more free -- you know, New York State is \nthe Free State.  Everything is free in New York.  Everybody wants \neverything for free. \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I didn't know that. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Well, we do everything in this \n-- in this Body to make things free, and I don't think they realize at \nsome point you're gonna run out of other people's money.  But bottom \nline is, what you're doing here is tying landlords' hands by -- if they \nwere to accept because they couldn't raise the rent.  What if they \nrepaired?  Could they get the repair money back?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n349MS. ROSENTHAL:  I -- I -- I wish you'd try to think \nback to when COVID was. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Oh, I think about COVID, Ms. \n--  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  So many people were \nunemployed.  So many people wished they could pay rent but they \ndidn't have a job.  If you remember the unemployment insurance, \nyou'll remember how ERAP was created on the Federal level because \nso many people could not pay the rent.  And so many, many landlords \nwere very happy to accept the rent.  In fact, we created a whole \nseparate fund for landlords. \nMR. MORINELLO:  All right.  So let me ask you \nthis:  Let's assume a landlord refused the rent, but that tenant had \ndamaged the property.  Would they be able to proceed on an eviction \nfor damage to the property?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I don't know if landlords evict \npeople based on damage.  If they want to try to evict, I guess they'll \ncall the tenant into court and they would be allowed to do so. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Okay.  Thank you very much \nfor answering the questions. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n350Ms. Walsh. \nMS.

PEOPLES-STOKES:  Madam Speaker, the \nMajority Conference is gonna be in favor of this piece of legislation; \nhowever, there may be some that would desire to be an exception.  \nThey should feel free to do so. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nThe Clerk will record the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)\nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.) \nThe bill is passed.  \nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  We are moving right \nalong here.  We're gonna go to the next four bills that we have on our \nagenda for this evening.  They are Rules Report No. 668 by Mr. \nBronson, Rules Report No. 675 by Mr. Otis, Rules Report No. 686 by \nMs. Gallagher and Rules Report No. 698 by Mr. Pretlow. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Page 18, Rules \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n351Report No. 668, the Clerk will read.\nTHE CLERK:  Senate No. A07388, Rules Report No. \n668, Ms. -- Senator Ramos (Bronson, Colton, Jacobson, \nLasher--A07863).  An act to amend the Labor Law, in relation to \nenacting the \"remedial construction of New York Labor Law Act\".  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Bronson. \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  This bill \ncodifies roughly 70 years of jurisprudence  directing courts to interpret \nthe provisions of the New York Labor Law liberally for the \naccomplishment of their remedial purposes.  The courts would also be \ndirected to interpret any exceptions or exemptions narrowly to -- to \ndeter unlawful conduct.  This bill will protect workers and prevent \nharm to workers from unscrupulous employers who seek to \ncircumvent the labor law.  The bill is good for workers and good for \nfair, law-abiding employers. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Durso.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes, I will, Madam Speaker.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Mr. Bronson.  So, what is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n352the reason for codifying into law now?\nMR. BRONSON:  Yes.  Through you, Madam \nSpeaker, we need to do this right now because notwithstanding 70 \nyears of courts interpreting our New York State labor laws in a liberal \nfashion, for the purpose of benefiting workers and to make sure that \nemployers abide by the law as constructed by New York State.  We \nhave seen recent and -- and historically, the National Labor Relation \n[sic] Act has been said to be parallel to many of our New York State \nLabor Laws; like, wage laws, minimum wage, overtime, things of that \nnature.  So, typically the courts say, we're gonna interpret similar to \nour interpretation under the National Labor Relations Act.  \nUnfortunately, there's been a divergent by some federal courts, not \nmost, but some federal courts, who are no longer interpreting and \nmaking sure that our laws -- our New York State Labor Laws are \nliberally construed for the benefit of workers.  So, to make sure that \nthat trend doesn't continue and to fulfill the policy of New York State \nof having worker protection, we're codifying this statutory \nconstruction.  \nMR. DURSO:  So, will this bill in any way, shape or \nform, circumvent or sidestep federal law when it comes to labor \nprotections at all?  \nMR. BRONSON:  No.  This -- this bill is about the \ninterpretation of New York State Labor Law.  And this bill, as -- \nagain, is codifying 70 years of court cases and this bill is making sure \nthat we're protecting workers here in New York State.  This is not a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n353unique situation.  We have precedent for it.  We codified, I believe it \nwas in 2019, the same provision for our Human Rights Law, \nAntidiscrimination Laws here in New York State.\nMR. DURSO:  So, in other words, if -- let's say that \nthere is a labor issue that needs to be looked at by federal courts and \nthey -- they, essentially, don't have the judges, or courts, or the \navailability to look into these cases.  Will New York State then step in \nto make sure that those New York State workers are protected?  Or -- \nMR. BRONSON:  No.  No.  This is if you have a \nplaintiff or you could have a -- a plaintiff whether it's the -- on the \nemployee side or the employer side and the court is being asked to \ninterpret New York State Labor Law, this is going to require that court \nto do so under the policy of the state, which is to construct it liberally \nfor the remedial purposes of the law; and that is to protect workers and \nmake sure employers are acting fairly in the workplace.\nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  And then just for clarification; \nwhen we say, to look at the law \"liberally\".  Can you just explain what \nyou mean in regards to labor protections?  \nMR. BRONSON:  So that means not to construe it \nrestrictively.  Not to narrow the interpretation in such a way that \nyou're not fulfilling the -- the intent and the spirit of our labor laws \nand that general policy is twofold.  One, is to protect workers and, \ntwo, is to make sure that employers are on a level playing field, \nbecause we're requiring employers to act within the law. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Bronson.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n354That's all the questions I have for you.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\nMR. BRONSON:  Thank you.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Sempolinski.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  On the bill.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I just want to, sort of -- I \nguess, sort of explain my vote.  I'm going to be voting no and I don't \nwant it to be interpreted as I'm for or against any particular provision \nof labor law, or for or against labor in general.  But, on principle, I \nfeel that this type of law, though, I know there are others on the books, \nis inappropriate telling judges to squint at statute in a particular way, I \nfeel is unconstitutional.  Article 3, Section 1 of the New York State \nConstitution reads in its entirety:  The legislative power of the State \nshall be vested in the Senate and Assembly.  If we want to have a \nliberal labor law, we should write a liberal labor law.  If we want to \nhave more constrained labor law, we should write a more constrained \nlabor law.  That's our job.  That's what we're here to do.\nSo, on -- on principle, I can't vote for this type of law, \nbut I'm happy to consider any proposals that the sponsor or anyone \nelse puts forward in the labor sector. \n(Pause)\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n355THE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMr. Bronson to explain his vote. \nMR. BRONSON:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  I abstain \nfor the purposes of explaining my vote.  I don't want us to get hung up \non the word \"liberal\".  This isn't the political context.  We're not \ntalking about liberals and conservative.  This is talking about what the \nintent of our labor laws are and the bill merely requires what many \ncourts have held until recently.  And that is, the New York Labor Law \nwas written to protect workers from unlawful and abusive practices.  It \nwas also written to make sure that employers operate within the \nframework of the law and to keep them on a level playing field.  You \ncan look at misclassification of workers and independent contractor \nsituations.  You can look at employers who cheat their -- their \nemployees on overtime, or on paying minimum wage, or on break \ntime.  Things of that nature.  All we're saying is to the court, to look at \nthose cases and construe the law in a fashion that fills the purpose and \nthe spirit and intent of the labor laws.  And that is to protect workers \nand to keep employers honest and lawful.  \nSo, for those reasons, Madam Speaker, I withdraw \nmy request and I will vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Bronson in the \naffirmative.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n356(Pause)\nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.) \nThe bill is passed.\nPage 19, Rules Report No. 675, the Clerk will read.  \nTHE CLERK:  Senate A07501-A, Rules Report No. \n675, Senator Mayer (Otis, Buttenschon, Clark, Lupardo, Santabarbara, \nEachus, Levenberg, Kelles, Bendett, Lunsford, Burdick, Maher, \nSimpson, Angelino, Shimsky, Barrett, Glick, Blumencranz, \nDeStefano, Reyes, Jacobson, Steck, Seawright, Gray, Blankenbush, \nGallahan, McDonald--A08086A).  An act to amend the General \nMunicipal Law and the Public Health Law, in relation to emergency \nmedical services.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Otis.  \nMR. OTIS:  This is an important piece of legislation \nto deal with an issue that the Legislature and the Executive have been \nunable to come to conclusion on which is, how do we move this State \nforward in terms of remedying a crises in EMS service around the \nState?  Around the State, we have services that are dropping out.  We \nhave trouble maintaining staffing.  We have trouble in terms of \nresponse time, the response time numbers are getting worse and so, \nthere have been proposals before the Legislature the last few years and \nproposals discussed in this year's budget to try and come to grips with \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n357this and come with -- come up with a path forward.  The efforts by the \nGovernor and the two Houses in the budget this year were \nunsuccessful and so there was nothing in the budget to sort of provide \nthe EMS reform kind of model that many of us are looking for.  Some \ntalk of it in terms of it defining it as an essential service, but really, the \n-- the main goal is to make sure that there's reliable EMS service for \nevery resident of the State. \nWhat this bill does, at least provides an important \nstep forward for the rest of this year, which is it asks counties to \nconvene meetings and a planning process with the villages, cities and \ntowns within those counties, those four different kinds of \nmunicipalities to be equal partners and to also work with other people \n-- other groups already involved.  The not-for-profits, the for-profits, \nthe fire districts and others providing service to do a number of \nimportant things; to evaluate the existing level of service in their \ncounty, to come up with a plan for how they're going to address areas \nthat need increased service in their county.  There are areas where \nservice has been diminished, where there are gaps.  This is the kind of \nplan they should come up with to choose what would be the best \norganizational structure within the county to deal with this -- with this \nissue especially in areas where service needs to be improved.  And \nfinally and very importantly, to come up with cost estimates to \nprovide service going forward; something that will be important for \nthis Legislature to deal with next Session as we try and understand not \njust where the gaps are, but what it will take to close those gaps.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n358And how important this is?  This is important \nbecause we're losing lives when people don't get emergency service \nresponse in a timely fashion.  We need to do -- do something about it.  \nThis legislation respects the different kinds of structures and as \nopposed to the other kinds of approaches that have been sort Albany \ndown, top down and you're going to do it this way.  This legislation \ngives it -- provides a process by which it's from the bottom up.  Let the \nlocals in each county figure out what's the best way to fill the gap \nareas and come back with a plan that we can look at, that the \nDepartment of Health can look at and we can come up with solutions \nthat will serve emergency response in an intelligent way throughout \nthe entire State, have us going in the right direction rather than the \nwrong direction.  \nHappy to take any questions. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Maher. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. OTIS:  Of course.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. MAHER:  Thank you for your leadership on this \nissue.  It's certainly a -- a something that's been a passion project of \nmine since I was elected.  I know it can be a complicated issue, so I \njust have a bunch of questions since the -- the bill did change.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n359Speaking to the bill changes, how has this bill changed from its \noriginal form?  What -- what is the meat of that change?  \nMR. OTIS:  So, the bill that we had in from last year \nand was moved to a certain degree in our House, passed the other \nHouse last year, was a comprehensive essential service -- treat EMS as \nan essential service bill, which many want around the State.  \nAlthough, there -- there -- it's -- as you said, it's complicated.  There \nare a lot of players and so we've not been able to get the two Houses to \neven agree, or the Governor to agree on a plan forward and so, my \nfeeling was, let's not have this legislative session be another year \nwhere we don't at least get people working on it.  My vision is that \nlet's get all the local people working together and the counties are \ngoing to convene these meetings, but it's not necessarily \ncounty-centric, because in some counties, the counties don't do EMS \nat all.  Sometimes they're done by fire districts, municipalities, \nfor-profit, non-for-profit.  So, let them tell us what would be best in \ntheir county and how they could grow in the gap areas in a way that is \n-- is true to what's going on there and I think that's a better path \nforward.  I -- I really do and I'm -- I'm a formal local official.  I deal \nwith EMS people and I -- I think if we really -- we want this to pass \nand we want it to get signed quickly because the bill actually asks that \nthey come up with a plan within six months.  And while that seems \nlike a short period of time, I will tell you, we don't want to waste -- we \ndon't want to be talking about this in 2027.  We want to talk about this \nin 2026, in next legislative session, when we have some feedback \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n360from these plans that -- that hopefully all the locals would -- would -- \nwould come together with. \nMR. MAHER:  Well, you bring up a good point and \nsome of the feedback I've gotten since this bill was rewritten a little \nbit, is that some of those partners, there's no real mandate for them to \nbe part of those county conversations and the way this bill is written, \nsome fear that it will be done by the counties with no feedback.  Is \nthat something that was a concern with you and the way the bill is \nwritten, is there really anything in there that mandates counties to \nwork with some of these partners?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, yes and actually, the bill is very \nintentionally written so -- someone has to call the meetings.  So, \ncounties will call the meeting, but the counties are -- have no higher \nplace than a village, a town, or a city in the -- in this -- in the way this \nis drafted.  So -- and that was very intentional because in some places, \nit may be a city does a really good job for their area, a town may do a \ngood job in their area and then there be -- may be other areas where \nthere are gaps.  There is some counties that aren't in the EMS space at \nall.  So, some of the other things that have been floating around made \nit all counties are going to come up with a county plan, but why would \nyou have a county do a county plan, when a county -- some counties \nmay have no experience in EMS.  \nSo, this is the right approach and I will just tell you, \nmy commitment is to work -- if -- if we get this signed, is also to work \nwith the various parties and the -- the associations; NYSAC, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n361Association of Towns, NYCOM to try and promote this process going \nforward.  I'm not here just to pass a bill and say, so long.  I think that \nwe want to make sure that the process between now and before we go \nto the next legislative session is productive, so that we all have \nsomething that we can make all the residents that we represent safer \nand that somebody can come and -- and provide emergency service \nwhen they need it. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  So, I agree with just about \neverything you said, but I think as the bill is written, there are some \nconcerns, especially feedback that I've gotten that there is no real \nmandate for the county to work with all those agencies you \nmentioned, although they should.  That's just one concern, but we can \ndefinitely move on from that.  \nWhen it comes to the potential estimates on funding, \nI know that we've been talking about this for a while, you've been \nchampioning it for a while, were there any estimates in your \ndiscussions that came up on what this potentially could cost Statewide \nand was that a roadblock during the discussions in the budget?  \nMR. OTIS:  No, we don't have estimates because \nactually, you know, one of the issues that has arisen in this is people \naren't really talking.  A lot of -- a lot of areas they -- they identify \ngaps, but they don't really -- maybe don't want to admit to all the gaps, \nbut -- but part of the -- part of the task is; come up with -- identify \nwhere service needs to be im -- improved, identify -- then we're going \nto have these four different entities sit down and others that are \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n362players within a given county and -- and then say, okay, here's where \nwe have a gap and let them say what would be the most efficient way \nto do it in our area and have them come up with cost estimates.  I don't \nthink they exist now and particularly added to this bill, which was not \nin the earlier drafts, was this request for cost estimates because I think \nwe need something of value to then come to grips with what we, at the \nState level, can do to help.  And -- and if we just say it's an essential \nservice and we don't provide any -- we don't have any sense of what it \ncosts, that's not really fair either.  So, I think this is an important step \nforward and I'm -- I -- you can tell my passion -- \nMR. MAHER:  I can tell. \nMR. OTIS:  -- but I, in a sense, like all of us, we've \nlost patience with the fact that we're losing service.  Every year, I get \nreports from around the State where -- where different services are \nclosing or shutting down because they can't make it work.  That's \nunacceptable.  And so, we can --\nMR. MAHER:  Sure.  No and --   \nMR. OTIS:  -- change direction and I think we're on \nthe same page. \nMR. MAHER:  I think we are, but I -- I think with the \nway that the bill is written, there -- there are come concerns and I \ndon't doubt the leadership you'll provide in your district and hopefully \nothers will do the same, but where there is a leadership gap and \ninformation gap to bring people together, I think we might have a \nproblem with how this bill is specifically written.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n363Speaking of unfunded mandates, I agree with you.  I \nthink if you pass essential service and don't have a dollar amount \nattached, it is essentially an unfunded mandate and we don't want that \neither.  This bill though, with the plans being put in place by counties, \nsome of those counties may want to choose to hire a consultant.  They \nmay want to choose not to just use in house or some of their partners.  \nBy them choosing to -- to go that route, wouldn't this bill then become \nan unfunded mandate in and of itself?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, you know, I would love to, as \nmany of us would, there are all sorts of things we would like; money \nand budgets to have happen, but the practical matter is, there's a great \ninterest of the local level to do something.  So, I think they will figure \nit out.  But, I also -- I -- I -- I -- in -- in -- in due difference, I'm not \nsure I agree with your characterization of the -- the language here \nbecause the language very specifically says, counties with cities, \ntowns and villages.  It's not like if they feel like it, it's -- it's -- it is \nsaying -- \nMR. MAHER:  So, you read it as shall.  Not may, \nshall. \nMR. OTIS:  Yeah -- yes and I think there's no way -- \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Good to know.\nMR. OTIS:  -- to do it correctly, unless you have all \nfour at the table. \nMR. MAHER:  I agree.  I'm just -- I'm glad that \nyou're mentioning that and your -- your view of how this is written is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n364they shall, because that should be put out that way to the counties as \nwell. \nMR. OTIS:  And we've enhanced the legislative \nrecord by this discussion. \nMR. MAHER:  That's the part -- that's our platform, \nright?  Okay, perfect. \nAll right.  So, moving on.  Were the regional EMS \ncouncils, the REMSCOs, were they talked to during this process when \nthis bill was amended?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, I mean, they have been part of the \n-- the Statewide discussion for a few years.  Did we speak to them in \nterms of the drafting of the bill?  No, but I have them down here.  I \nspecifically mentioned to be consult -- that they should be consulted \nas part of this because those are generally -- the list of people, I've \nlooked over -- over the list -- list of people, are people that are \ninvolved throughout the State in this.  So, you want to have them as \npart of the conversation.  I also think that counties within regions can \nlearn from each other, so having the -- the discussions going on with \nthe regional folks, will also maybe inform decisions that people made \ncoming up with these county plans. \nMR. MAHER:  Now, I don't disagree.  I know for \nsome of these EMS councils, it's going to be a bit of a -- a load \nbecause like many of them, I know the Hudson Valley I think there's \nseven different counties they'll be working with, right?  So, on top of \nthe workload that these providers are already, you know, servicing, it \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n365-- it could be quite a bit over the six-month period and -- and I want to \nask you, are you aware of some of the financial strains that are \ncurrently on those regional EMS's, those REMSCOs, those 18 \nthroughout the State?  \nMR. OTIS:  The whole system is under stress.  I \nmean, that's the whole point of -- of the problem we have here.  But, \nyou know, their role here, I mean, the language is in coordination with \ntheir regional emergency medical services council.  It's a consultation \nthing.  This is really meant to be counties, villages, cities and towns \nwithin a county sitting down with each other, but they should -- they \nshould be in consultation with the regional folks just so the regional \nfolks shouldn't be left out of the discussion and so that's either going \nto happen naturally, or not happen -- not naturally, or not, but it -- \nthey're listed here because clearly they should be some level involved. \nMR. MAHER:  I don't disagree.  So, just to bring to \nyour attention; in my conversations with the regional councils, they're \nhaving a major crisis in terms of cash flow.  They're operating on a -- \na contract from 2024.  They just had a new contract that was \napproved; however they have not been paid for a very long time.  I \nknow in the Hudson Valley alone, they're owed over $200,000 by the \nState.  I know that some county EMS' are actually consolidating now \nwith some of these REMSCOs because they have not had the cash \nflow to do the duties that they've been asked to do.  So, would you \nagree that it is incumbent on us as elected officials to use our positions \nwhether this bill is passed, or whatever happens, to actually work with \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n366DOH or whatever the State entity is that's holding these funds up, \nbecause what these regional -- those REMSCOs are being told is that \nsome of them have two months left in order to have any bills \nwhatsoever paid.  They're just going to be out of money in two \nmonths, but they're being told by the State that they're not going to \nreceive funds for five to six months.  Would you agree that that's a \nproblem that we ought to really figure out and use our offices to help?  \nMR. OTIS:  Absolutely, but I -- I would say more \nbroadly there are financial gaps in this whole system Statewide and so, \nthat's one piece of it, but there are the -- the financial viability of these \noperations around the State.  Others are going -- are going to close if \nwe don't do something.  So, it's part of a big -- bigger picture with \nDOB, with the Department of Health, with the Legislature, next year's \nBudget.  And -- and so, you're -- you're -- you're -- you're mentioning \na sliver, but it -- it's actually more endemic to have every one of these \nentities function.  They're having trouble holding on to staff. \nMR. MAHER:  I -- I don't disagree and I think \nobviously when it comes to the reimbursement and how funding gets \nto those local EMS agencies, we could do a lot more to get the \nbureaucracy and red tape out of the way there so they can have cash \nflow as well.  But when it comes to the REMSCOs, these are the folks \nthat are actually charged with creating the CONs.  I mean, they -- they \nhave a really essential job and what we're being told is within two to \nthree months, they may not have any -- enough cash flow to -- to exist.  \nSo, I just want to make sure that I have your word that we can partner \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n367on this to make sure that -- \nMR. OTIS:  Happy to do it. \nMR. MAHER:  -- we can get through this red tape so \nthose REMSCOs can, you know, be able to provide their service.\nMR. OTIS:  Happy to do it. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you.  Awesome.  \nOkay.  So, we also just passed a -- another bill that I \nbelieve will have an impact on what we do here with the essential \nservice and this plan and that is to allow municipalities to override the \ntax gap.  Now, do you view that as creating a competitive \ndisadvantage with some of the private companies in terms of service?  \nMR. OTIS:  Actually, I don't because if a private \ncompany is, as many are, contracted with municipalities, I don't see \nhow -- my belief is that those funds could be used --\nMR. MAHER:  It's for them as well. \nMR. OTIS:  -- to -- to for them as well.  And I'd said \nfor the four profits, if you look at the language of the bill, I \nspecifically mention for-profits to give them respect and to show we \nunderstand that they're an important part of the mix.  So, it -- it -- \nthey're there because we understand they're an important part of the \npuzzle and they should feel that this is something that would be \nhelpful to them, as well as we also mentioned the not-for-profits, we \nmentioned the municipals, we also mentioned this could be done by \ninter-municipal agreement by district.  So, my view is that as locals \ncome up with choices for organizational structure, they should be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n368aware of the full range of options they have before then for setting up \nan improved service in their area. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you for that.  The six-month \ntime frame, where did that come from?  Why do we pick six months?  \nMR. OTIS:  Because January is essentially six \nmonths away and while it seems like it's quick, we would -- I would \nhope to be able to make some other advances in the next legislative \nsession.  So, if that -- if people are concerned that's a short period of \ntime to figure out something more complicated, well, do what all of us \ndo, which is work hard with very little time to do quality work and -- \nand I know when I was at the local level, that's what you do.  You do \nwhat you do within the time frames that are needed to get things done.  \nThis is the health and safety of people, so what -- we shouldn't wait, I \ndon't want, as I said earlier, I don't want to wait till 2027 to make \nfurther gains.  We want to build on these plans and figure out a path \nforward in the next legislative session. \nMR. MAHER:  So, the plan is and the reason why the \nsix- month time frame was selected, is there is a real desire by this \nBody and hopefully both bodies and the Governor to put some sort of \nfunding in place to not create an unfunded mandate if and when we \nreally do essential service, potentially in the next legislative session. \nMR. OTIS:  Well, I would hope so.  I -- I mean, I \nwould say, you know, in speaking to local governments around the \nState, you'd get different perspectives on the -- the mandate issue.  \nSome local governments say, we just want to do it.  We'll raise the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n369taxes, we don't, you know.  And others say, no, we want money.  We \nshould address with the different kinds of needs and be flexible -- \nflexible with that.   But, it -- it's not uniform and some -- some \nmunicipalities wanted the essential service mandate because they \nwanted to say, oh, well, we need -- we're required to do it and we're \ngoing to raise your taxes to do it.   \nMR. MAHER:  So --\nMR. OTIS:  Someone's going to have to pay.  You \nknow, you -- if you're -- if you're going to hire additional people and \nyou're going to do ambulant -- higher -- equipment stuff, we're going \nto have to come up with some money somewhere. \nMR. MAHER:  So, you bring up another great point \nand -- and I'm happy we're doing this because I think people have a lot \nof questions and right now, you're answering them and I -- I really \nthink we ought to be able to put something out to them from, you \nknow, your leadership and whoever's responsibility it's going to be, \nreal clear direction that states exactly what should be happening, what \nthe benchmarks are.  When it comes to all of these partners that we \nhave in place, it is essential that they know what their roles are \nbecause right now from the feedback that I've gotten, it seems like \nthere's a bit of confusion.  So, I think going forward, being able to \nmake sure we make it clear how this is going to work is important, \nespecially the desire to create a funding mechanism and the reason \nthat six-month time frame was selected is for that purpose, because a \nlot of folks are saying it's not enough time.  They're probably right, but \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n370what you're saying is, hey, we've waited too long.  This is a dire \nemergency , people are dying and that's why we have to get our acts \ntogether and work together .  Is that what I'm basically hearing?  \nMR. OTIS:  That is correct. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Me and you can agree on that.  \nI think with enough collaboration and communication, we can \ndefinitely answer folks' questions, but they certainly have a lot of \nquestions, which a lot of them are getting answered here. \nOkay.  I appreciate all of your answers.\nI'm going to go on the bill, Madam Speaker.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MAHER:  All right.  So, during my time as a \nsupervisor of the Town of Montgomery in 2020, one of the first things \nthat I did was I identified the fact that we had a very significant \nshortfall in our EMS services.  I learned like many of my colleagues \nwhat the difference was between ALS and BLS services, that folks \nwere not able to provide those ALS support.  We were getting it \nfunded privately and then the private companies did not have enough \nstaffing to provide the ALS services and folks who had a heart attack \nwe're waiting 45 minutes, if at all, to even get service to have \nlifesaving treatment.  Unacceptable.  That was 2020.  Our reality is the \nsame, the only thing that's changed are some municipalities, like the \nsponsor has mentioned, invested in their own ambulance districts.  I \nthink when it comes to this process and this crisis we're facing, it's \nmultifaceted, it's going to take a very, very combined effort approach \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n371and we absolutely will need to provide funding for some of these \nmunicipalities because without funding, the municipalities have not \nbeen able to proceed and move forward.  \nSo, I think this is something that can create a positive \nstep, but we should acknowledge that that six-month period is going \nto be very, very challenging for these counties.  And as much as we \nhave the partners that are ready and available to work together, those \nof us who have served in elected office know how local politics can \nbe, how territorial folks can be.  So, overcoming that is going to create \n-- is -- is going to be really our necessary ability as legislators to also \nbe leaders in our community, to assist as this legislation is passed.  \nWhen we talk about the labor shortages, it's really \nbad.  And when it comes to the counties, I think it was probably worth \nsome language in here, but I know that we could probably Monday \nmorning quarterback a lot of this.  We definitely want to have the \ncounties make sure they know and are cognisant of the fact that if they \ntry to create too many new agencies, there isn't enough of a workforce \nout there to support those agencies.  So, building off existing agencies \nis likely the best way to go.  I would've like to have seen some of that \nlanguage in this bill, but, obviously, it's going to be a start and we'll \nhave to finish and get there together.  But, I definitely want to make \nsure that -- that everyone in here is cognisant of the fact that if we \ndeclared EMS an essential service tomorrow, we simply do not have \nthe staffing to provide the services.  So, we need to really think \nlong-term in a sustainable way, what that's going to look like and in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n372reality, it's going to include a lot of money.  Because let's say we do \nincrease the number of agencies and we increase the number of \nemployees and we're having these folks fight over these employees, it \nis going to raise the amount that these employees are paid which is \ngreat.  Our EMS providers are some of the most underpaid first \nresponders in the country, especially in the State of New York.  We \nwant them to be paid more.  However, that means this State, this \nLegislature, is going to have to fund it properly.  It cannot be a \nhalf-funded or an unfunded mandate if we're going to go through this \nprocess.  Hopefully, next year we're here and we're addressing this \nwith a meaningful dollar amount through the budget process.  So, it's \nimportant for me to ask these questions, to put all of these things on \nthe table in the light of day, or the night, as we are here.  But, I just \nwanted to make sure that we are all eyes wide open on the enormous \nchallenge that's ahead of us.  \nI -- I do believe in this bill.  I think it has some \nchallenges associated with it, but I'm ready to meet those challenges \nand I'm looking forward to working with the sponsor of this bill and \nthose in my community to make the best of this bill in our opportunity \nmoving forward.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Angelino. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you.  Would you ask the \nsponsor to yield, please?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n373yield. \nMR. OTIS:  Of course. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. ANGELINO:  First off, I'm a cosponsor on this, \nthank you.  And this is not an antagonistic question.  Do you have \nexperience in this so that maybe we can talk later, also?  \nMR. OTIS:  Well, I was a mayor -- \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.\nMR. OTIS: -- and the way we do it in the community \nthat I served in in local office, we had a not-for-profit that was really \nan instrument of three municipalities; two villages and a city, and \nthat's the entity that provides the service.  And we funded part of it, \nbut it -- it struggles.  And so currently the local officials down there \nactually are thinking that maybe they should move to a district. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  I represent five counties \nand I have five different ways of providing it.  I have an urban county, \nBroome County, that the county's not really involved -- I shouldn't say \nthey're not involved, but heavily involved, but there isn't a -- a county \nagency.  The other four rural counties all have bit the bullet and have \nprovided some sort of countywide EMS.  Some 18 hours a day, some \n24/7.  It's four different -- four different ways of doing it.  \nWhat -- what are your thoughts on -- I'm trying to \nroundtable this because somehow I think I'm gonna get involved in \nthis in one of the counties.  One time as a police chief career I \nunwillingly had to take over a four-ambulance fire station.  And so I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n374got deeply involved.  I know these regional medical councils.  Some \nof them can do things wildly different one township away just where \nthe lines are drawn.  What are your feelings on those regional \ncouncils?  \nMR. OTIS:  I mean, my -- my feeling, really, and you \n-- you've spoken to it, it makes the point of my belief which is we \nhave to respect the variety of ways the services provided around the \nState and -- and leave it to local people to figure out which is the best \nmodel.  So in some places the counties play a big role and dive into it, \nand other places they contract out.  In other places they do a fire \ndistrict.  They do an inter-municipal agreement.  And I actually don't \nthink we should tell them you have to do it a certain way.  I think that \nlet them figure out which is the way with the local dynamics that they \nhave, but I think we want to provide the tools so that the service gets \nprovided in a reliable way so that people aren't waiting an -- an in -- \nan unacceptable length of time to get an ambulance to them. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Oh, a lot of the problem, I can tell \nyou right now is, Medicaid reimbursement.  And, you know, that's not \na question, it's a conversation. \nMR. OTIS:  (Indiscernible) that was not dealt with in \nthis year's budget.  It's something that really needs to be revisited.  I \nwould think more generally in this year's budget because there's great \nfear about what Washington is gonna do to healthcare funding that \nprobably people were probably a little gun shy about -- about \nadjusting that, knowing that we are likely to be getting hit in that in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n375severe ways.  But yes, that is an area that reimbursement rates -- we -- \nwe dealt with last year the issue of treat but not transport getting \nreimbursement for that.  It was a good step.\nMR. ANGELINO:  We -- we have been doing little \nnibbles here and there.  There's a lot to be done.  I know the -- the \ndirect payment from insurance companies was a huge help.\nMR. OTIS:  Yup.\nMR. ANGELINO:  My ambulance company that -- \nwe were losing about $200,000 a year of checks that were sent out but \nnot to us. \nThere's no real funding in this.  I know some counties \nare gonna want to -- they're gonna to see that six-month time frame \nand they're gonna want to jump into this and maybe hire a consultant.  \nSo, you know, that's kind of what I'm worried about.  They're gonna \nsay, You're making us do it and there's no funding for it. \nMR. OTIS:  Well, we -- you know, we're all \nlegislators and we can do what we can do and we can't do what we \ncan't do.  And so I -- I think that people are -- are -- I'd -- when I was a \nlocal official, sometimes we did plan some things with no outside \nmoney.  We just did plans and got people in a room and figured out, \nand I believe that that can happen here. \nMR. ANGELINO:  The rural areas that I have, the \nbig problem is for-profits and even not-for-profits can't -- it's the \nstranded cost of rural distance to the nearest hospital and the \nturnaround time.  You know, in the City of Syracuse they can run four \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n376calls an hour.  Where -- where I am it might take one call two hours, if \nyou're lucky.  But I -- you're talking about the six-month time frame \nand getting ready for next year's budget, and that's assuming that we \npass it tonight and the Governor signs it tomorrow. \nMR. OTIS:  We'll do what we can. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  I don't know how that \nworks, but they usually happen in between Thanksgiving and \nChristmas. \nMR. OTIS:  We're -- we're -- certainly it's my \nintention to request that the bill get taken up by the Executive sooner \nrather than later. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  Thank you.  That -- that's \na big concern with that six-month time crunch.  \nI believe that's it.  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I am \ndone. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.    \nMR.

Announce the results.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n377(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nPage 19, Rules Report No. 698, the Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  Senate No. A08413, Rules Report No. \n698, Senator Gounardes (A08870, Pretlow).  An act in relation to \nauthorizing a loan from the State to the City of Dunkirk (Part A); and \nmaking an appropriation therefor (Part B).   \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  On the bill, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So, this is a Governor [sic]  \nProgram Bill that authorizes a loan to the City of Dunkirk, which is a \ncity in my district.  And I just want to share a little bit of background \ninformation about this so that everyone knows what they're voting for. \nSo, the City of Dunkirk is a small city with a \npopulation of slightly over 12,000 people.  Fifty percent of its citizens \nidentify as a member of a racial or ethnic minority.  Twenty percent \nspeak a primary language other than English.  Twenty percent are \nsenior citizens on a fixed income.  And the average household income \nis $49,000.  Nearly two-thirds of the residents of the City of Dunkirk \nown their home.  Last year, through the budget, this Body approved \n$18.2 million in municipal bond funding so that the City could begin \nto get itself out of a fairly large deficit.  That was legislation I would \nhave supported had I been here, because it authorized the City to sell \nbonds to raise enough money to address the deficit, pay back the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n378bonds, and most importantly, provided some financial oversight by the \nComptroller.  In the intervening months since that legislation was \npassed, the City's financial situation has worsened.  The deficit has \ngrown to over $20 million, and we still don't know what the total \ndeficit amount is gonna be because the audits haven't been completed. \nIt has been reported that the Comptroller's Office has \nopened an investigation into the City's finances, and there are many \nissues with the City's operational budget.  Property taxes this year \nhave increased 84 percent, and that's with the hope that the budget \nwill be balanced.  There are residents of the City of Dunkirk that are \ncoming to the Real Property Tax Department in the City, and they are \nstruggling.  They don't know whether they're gonna have -- whether \nthey're gonna have to pay their property taxes or whether they're \ngonna be able to meet -- you know, they're gonna have enough money \nfor their basic necessities.  \nAs of May 30th of this year, the Comptroller's Office \nin a letter has reported that the City has not acted with the urgency and \ntransparency required to address their financial situation.  And if that \nwasn't all enough, the City owes $12.7 million on a revenue \nanticipation note by July -- so next month -- or they will default.  And \nwhile I understand that a loan to the City is necessary so that \nmunicipal bond ratings Statewide will not be affected, this bill gives \ntaxpayer money to a city without the financial oversight and \nprotection City residents need and that the loan of taxpayer funds \nshould require.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n379With the loss of their AIM funding, which is \ncontemplated by this loan and the anticipated repayment of municipal \nbonds once issued, Dunkirk taxpayers will likely see more dramatic \ntax increases.  These tax increases and -- and their detrimental effect \nupon Dunkirk's economy will drive away businesses and residents in a \narea of my district that is already depressed.  If your car tire popped, \nyou wouldn't try to put air into it, you would fix it.  Why would we \ngive the City more money without requiring stringent controls and \nfinancial accountability so that we can have a fix?  Why does the \ninterest rate on this loan have to be so high?  Why can't we preserve \nmore AIM funding?  With the loss of AIM funding their revenue is \ngonna go down and they're gonna have to increase taxes for that as \nwell. \nI fear that we'll be back here before long, addressing \nthe same underlying problem this bill fails to fix.  And for all these \nreasons, I cannot ask any of you to support this bill, and I will not be \nsupporting it, either.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS.

JACKSON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n382allowing me to speak on this important resolution. \nJuneteenth.  What is that, right?  Let me give you a \nlittle bit of history.  The name is a play on the date of June 19, 1865.  \nOn that day the Union Army made its way to Galveston, Texas under \nthe leadership of General Granger to announce that enslaved African- \nAmericans were free.  But if you all remember, President Lincoln \nfreed enslaved Africans in -- in the rebelling states in [sic] January 1, \n1863.  That's a straight L to the Confederates; such losers.  And just a \nreminder that the Civil War ended in April of 1865.  Just because \nLincoln dropped the Emancipation Proclamation for states that \nrebelled didn't free all enslaved people throughout the nation.  Think \nabout states like Maryland that didn't succeed [sic] from the Union, \nbut they still maintained slavery.  What truly abolished slavery for \nUnion states was the end of the Civil War and the passage of the 13th \nAmendment.  Now, I can go into an entire lesson about the 13th, 14th \nand 15th Amendment and how this Federal Government has worked \nto dismantle over the years, but we have to get back to Juneteenth; \nJuneteenth and its impact in the State of New York. \nNew York abolished slavery in 1827, so you can say \nwe are trendsetters in that regard.  And -- and it wasn't because this \nState loved African-Americans so much and they finally became \nGod-like, but its economic impact no longer fit the needs of the State.  \nAnd so Juneteenth was made a State Holiday in Texas in 8 -- in 1980.  \nIt was first officially observed in New York in 2004.  The Federal \nGovernment made it an official holiday on June 17, 2021.  New York \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n383pretty much teaches the nation how things ought to be done.  So if you \nwent to high school, like myself, in Harlem, you -- you never learned \nabout Juneteenth.  I found out about Juneteenth for the first time as a \nadult when I visited Texas.  And so some of you may wonder, you \nknow, how do you celebrate Juneteenth and what is appropriate -- and \nnow this is the really important part -- what is appropriate?  And the \nfirst thing I would say is that we must remember its origins.  We must \nremember, this is -- this is about enslaved African-Americans and no \nelse receiving their freedom.  So don't conflate it with anything else.  \nAnd I know this ain't Texas, but back there they love to barbecue and \ngather.  It's, you know, pretty revolutionary for Black people to -- to \ngather.  But I believe in the good Lord who said where two or three \nare gathered, you are there in the midst.  So I offer that people \nbarbecue and gather, and it's safe to do so.  Others may choose to rest \nand remember our ancestors who were stolen from their homeland.  \nWho were stripped of their native tongues and their customs.  Who \nsurvived and/or perished the Middle Passage.  Who built this country \nfrom the ground up for free.  Who experienced Black Codes and \nReconstruction and Jim Crowe and mass in -- incarceration so that I \ncan stand here as Chair of the Black Task Force.  So that Majority \nLeader Crystal Peoples-Stokes can be here as our Majority Leader, \nand our Speaker Carl Heastie can be here as the Speaker.  You know, \nthis doesn't happen easy.  It just -- it just means it's a lot of work, a lot \nof years of us staying dedicated as a people.  \nAnd so, Madam Speaker, I say to you and all my \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n384Black colleagues and community, Happy Freedom Day.  Happy \nJuneteenth.  And just because it's Black Music Month I have to say, \nHate it or love it , the underdog's on top and we gon' shine until our \nhearts stop [sic ].  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes on the resolution. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  I first want to commend the sponsor of this resolution \nbecause it's important to remember history.  I know, you know, we're \n-- we're living in a time when some people just really wanna deny it \nand think that there was no history and trying to erase it, but that's not \ngonna happen.  It's kind of too late for that.  Some people already \nknow it and, quite frankly, those of us who do are gonna continue to \nshare it. \nI had the honor and the pleasure to walk with the \nGovernor as well as the Attorney General on Saturday in the 49th \nAnnual Juneteenth parade in the great City of Buffalo.  And so next \nyear we will be celebrating 50 years.  So I know some -- some just \nfound out about it, as our sponsor mentioned, but some of us have \nbeen born and raised on understanding what our history is.  And so I \nwould give you a early invite; next Juneteenth come to Buffalo and \nsee how we do it when we celebrate the heritage of people who \nunderstand that they were enslaved, but also understand that they are \nnow free.  So I invite you to come, and thank you so much to the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n385sponsor for introducing this piece of legislation -- resolution. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Meeks on the \nresolution. \nMR. MEEKS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I want \nto say thank you to -- to my colleague for introducing this resolution. \nJuneteenth is a very, very important day to celebrate, \nand I look forward to celebrating in the Rochester community this \nThursday as well, as many of us celebrated this past Saturday.  But I \nimplore each of you to take time to go to your local libraries.  I know \nwe -- we advocate for a number of resources to go into our \ncommunities, and in particular to our libraries to make sure that we're \neducating our community.  I had the opportunity to go to a library in \nmy district which was one of the first libraries in my district named \nafter a historical ancestor, Phillis Wheatley, who was known as the \nfirst published Black poet.  And lo and behold, there were no outward \nbooks or information on Juneteenth.  And there was a number of other \nthings being celebrated.  And I posed the question, We're about \ncelebrating our diversity, our communities as a whole.  And, you \nknow, found the Juneteenth books and took it upon myself to make a \ndisplay in that moment, following reading those Juneteenth books to \nmy grandbabies.  But I implore each of you to go to your libraries and \nmake sure that Juneteenth is recognized and being shared throughout \nour communities, because we must be intentional in celebrating us \nand celebrating the history of our nation.   \nThank you. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                      JUNE 16, 2025\n386ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nOn the resolution, all those in favor signify by saying \naye; opposed, no.

PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you so much and \ngood morning, colleagues and guests that are in the Chambers.  I have \na quote I'd like to share with you all today.  This one comes from \nAmelia Ehrhardt, probably heard of her before.  She's an American \naviation pioneer.  She became the first woman to fly solo across the \nAtlantic Ocean in 1937.  Her words for us today:  \"The most difficult \nthing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity.\"  Again, these \nwords from Amelia Everhart [sic].  \nMadam Speaker, members have on their desk a main \nCalendar.  After you have done any housekeeping and/or \nintroductions, we're going to begin our floor work by consenting bills \nstarting with Rules Report No. 642.  It's on page 17.  We'll then be \ncalling for the following committees to meet:  Ways and Means and \nRules.  Both of these committees are going to produce an A-Calendar \nwhich we will take up today.  \nThere may be a need for additional floor activities as \nwe proceed, Madam Speaker.  I will announce it at that moment.  So, \nthat's a general outline of where we're going today.  If you want to get \nstarted with housekeeping and introductions, it would be perfect.  \nThank you, ma'am. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n3ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  We are \nall excited today.  So, we have no housekeeping and one introduction. \nMr. Weprin for the purpose of an introduction. \nMR. WEPRIN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I have \nhere today visiting us, Ninfa Vargas (phonetic) and Thomas \nAvellaneda, parents of my Legislative Director, Alejandro \nAvellaneda, which many of you know.  Ninfa and Thomas came to the \nUnited States over 35 years ago from Mexico in search of the \nAmerican Dream.  The American Dream is different things for \ndifferent people, but for Ninfa and Thomas, it was simple.  All they \nhoped for was a place to work hard, make an honest living, raise their \nfamily and give their children the opportunities that they never had.  \nMadam Speaker, they found that dream in our great State -- State of \nNew York.  They've lived here for over 35 years, first in Corona, \nQueens and now in Midwood, Brooklyn.  They are beyond honored to \nbe here today.  Madam Speaker, please welcome Ninfa and Thomas to \nthe People's House. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On behalf of Mr. \nWeprin, the Speaker and all members, we welcome you, Ninfa and \nThomas to the Assembly Chamber and extend to you the privileges of \nthe floor.  We have had -- all had an opportunity to work with your \nson.  He is a very diligent, hard-working young man and it's always a \npleasure to see him and work with him.  So, you did a great job.  We \nhope you enjoy the proceedings today.  Thank you so very much for \njoining us. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n4(Applause)\nOn consent, page 17, Rules Report No. 642, the Clerk \nwill read. \nTHE CLERK:  Bill No. A00357-B, Rules Report No. \n642, Rajkumar, Jackson, Zaccaro, Levenberg.

COLTON:  To explain my vote.  This bill \nreplaces an existing section of the Real Property Action and \nProceeding [sic] Law, which provides for giving access to exist -- to \nexisting adjoining neighborhood property owners or tenants property \nwhen that access is required by another owner needing access for \nrepairs or improvements.  This existing section ensures the rights of \nboth parties are protected, but the new bill changes that and it changes \nit by favoring developers of larger developments, and even allowing \npermanent relocation extensions, or offsetting of chimneys, vents, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n5flues and exhausts on the adjoining property without requiring full \ninformation, or plans, or details of the existing changes.  This will \nresult in the need for the existing neighbor -- neighborhood owner, or \ntenant, needing to retain private attorneys and incurring other \nadditional expenses in order to protect their rights.  It will result in the \nadjoining property owners and tenants to incur these additional \nexpenses and to be subject to additional environmental rights and \nother expenses. \nTherefore, I withdraw my request and I vote in the \nnegative for this bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Colton in the \nnegative. \nAre there any other votes?

This legislation also adjusts eligibility for certain subsidies, \nclarifies a number of compliance-related provisions and modernizes a \nlaw, making it easier for life insurers to comply with the provisions.  \nThis bill is an important first step towards modernizing a centuries-old \nlaw that has not been changed for nearly 30 years.  Life insurance is \nan extension of the social safety net -- net protecting families in their \ntime of needy -- need.  Life insurance helps families and keep the \nlights on and roofs over their heads and keep college dreams alive in \nthe terrible event of a tragic loss.  This legislation will enable life \ninsurance companies to recruit and retain good agents so that they \nmay continue to offer a family the protection that they deserve.  \nI proudly vote in the -- in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Weprin in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

SCHIAVONI:  Good afternoon, Chair.  I come \nfrom Eastern Long Island and in the 1st Assembly District we are a \ncoastal community with several hundred miles of shoreline.  So, this \nmoney -- these monies in this particular bill are extremely important \nand I want to thank the prime sponsor on this for bringing this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n44forward.  Not only does -- this would address nitrogen and phosphorus \ncoming through our homes in our effluent that will be going into the \nunconfined aquifer on Long Island.  That is the source of our drinking \nwater.  In addition, that will also find its way into our bays and \nharbors.  So, increasing money and -- and -- and resources to mitigate \nnitrogen and phosphorus is absolutely essential.  On Long Island, we \nhave no viable alternative for drinking water, other than the aquifer \nthat's underneath us.  \nI will be voting in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Schiavoni in \nthe affirmative.\nMs. Kassay to explain her vote. \nMS. KASSAY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  As a \nmember of this Body representing the 4th District on Long Island, I \nam very, very proud to be sponsoring this bill.  This bill great -- more \ngreatly facilitates the reimbursement for septic and cesspool upgrades, \nnot only on Long Island, but throughout the State of New York. \nSeventy percent of Suffolk County residents still use \nantiquated cesspools and septic systems.  The old systems do not filter \nout nitrogen or other pollutants.  The waste is mixing in our \ngroundwater, which not only seeps into our harbors, bays, beaches, \nrivers, streams and lakes, but also flows from the taps of -- for the 8 \nmillion residents of Long Island.  This excess nitrogen has led to \nsignificant amounts of harmful algal blooms throughout the fresh and \nsaltwater bodies across Long Island.  These blooms are lethal to our \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n45shellfish and fish populations and they damage our wetlands.  \nThe public has expressed a great interest in the septic \nreplacement program, which is already established in Suffolk County.  \nHomeowners can replace the old septic systems with the new IA \nsystems, which more -- more effectively treat nitrogen in the \nwastewater.  This is not only significant for Long Island, but also \ncommunities in the Great Lakes, Finger Lakes and Adirondack Parks.  \nI am proud to be delivering not only on an environmental goal to \nprotect our waterways, but also my commitment to bringing more \nfunds home to the residents of Long Island to offset costs for making \nsure that our environmental responsibility has that fiscal support along \nwith it.\nSo, I very proudly am affirmative to vote on this \nlegislation.  Thank you very much. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Kassay in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Giglio to explain her vote. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker and I'd \nlike to thank the sponsor for bringing this legislation forward.  In \nSuffolk County, we have 360,000 properties that are on conventional \nsanitary systems, some being very close to the water and some \nactually sitting in groundwater.  So, promoting these ideas along with \nlaws that South Hampton and other towns in Suffolk County have \nestablished to require these systems be changed over if they're doing a \nsubstantial improvement, is really very important, because the cost of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n46these systems can go up to anywhere from 35- to $50,000.  So, any \nhope that -- help that a homeowner can get to improve the \nenvironment and to change out these systems is a benefit.\nSo, again I want to thank the sponsor and it's an \nexcellent bill and it'll protect our groundwater and protect our \nsurrounding water and our recreational water.  So, thank you very \nmuch.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Giglio in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Lavine to explain his vote.  \nMR. LAVINE:  Thank you.  So, this is -- this is a \ngreat concept and this is really a great bill.  This is going to help folks \nwho cannot get direct sewer access to be able to utilize, to help \npurchase modern equipment that's going to protect Mother Earth.  \nNow, we focused on Suffolk County in the discussions, but in the \nneighborhood that I live on on the North Shore of Nassau County \nthere are many homes that simply are not able to connect to sewer \nsystems. This is a good thing and I want to commend the sponsor, and \nI not only want to commend the sponsor but say thanks from a lot of \nmy neighbors.  I'm voting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Lavine in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Burdick to explain his vote. \nMR. BURDICK:  Thank you for the opportunity to \nexplain my vote.  Representing some rural areas in northern \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n47Westchester, this bill is of great importance to those who have septic \nsystems that either are failing or are prone to failure at any moment's \ntime.  And so this is a terrific way of approaching it.  The enhanced \nseptic systems are tried and tested out on -- on -- in many areas of the \ncountry including on the Cape.  This is technology that works \nextremely well, and I'm very pleased to see that this bill is getting over \nthe finish line.  I commend the sponsor and also thank the Speaker for \nbringing this bill to the floor.  Thank you.

You know, sometimes \npeople say,  what do you guys do during the summer when you're not \nin Session?  So, this past summer Mr. Bendett and myself went out to \nthe National Guard to meet with their Countermeasure Task Force and \nthey talked about the fact they've been surveying a lot of stores in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n54Capital Region that were selling a lot of these concoctions with \nvarious amounts of kratom in it, because it's not a regulated substance.  \nAnd in -- in other states, the first measure is, well, let's ban it.  The \nreality is, and I can say this from a health background, there are \npeople I know that actually see benefit from kratom.  I think there's a \nbenefit to at least maybe having it a little bit more standardized, which \nis a different day and a different discussion.  But today, what we're \ndoing is, we're saying we care about our children.  We're gonna make \nsure that retailers are not selling these products in their retail \nestablishments to individuals under the age of 21.  And in this \nconversation, I've had great support not only from the different kratom \norganizations throughout the country, but more importantly, from a lot \nof the convenient stores who say, we understand this.  We get it.  This \nis about making sure that we're protecting  our youngest.  \nSo, I want to thank you once again and I will be \nvoting in the affirmative.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. McDonald in \nthe affirmative. \nMr. Ra to explain his vote. \nMR.

So, I know we did another piece of legislation \nthat -- that we had moving recently.  This, I think, is a start to \nregulating this substance.  We need to make sure we are protecting \nour -- our constituents and certainly our -- our -- our young people \nwith -- with regard to this substance.  \nSo, I thank the sponsor and I'll be voting in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Ra in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Walsh to explain her vote.\nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I too \nhave had constituents reach out to me with some very, very sad stories \nabout the use of kratom resulting in death.  And I would dedicate my \nvote today to Nickolas Scribner and the Scribner family, who has \nundergone just unimaginable pain upon losing their son, Nick.  And I \nwas shocked because a couple of doors down from my district office \nis just a -- a gas station with a little store and you go into that store \nand -- and the entire back wall of the store was covered in all different \nkinds of products that had kratom in them.  So, the work that we've \ndone this Session, I think, is a really important step to provide \nappropriate warnings on the product and also to make sure that only \nthose over 21 are going to be able to -- to purchase.  \nSo, I -- I dedicate this to Nick Scribner and to the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n56Scribner family and I'll be in the affirmative.

Unbeknownst to his family, Beau struggled with \nsubstance abuse.  He had been dismissed from school for poor \nattendance and had to be resuscitated on multiple occasions.  Only \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n61after his death did Beau's friends inform his family of his struggles.  \nBeau's cousin, Alexa Freidman, who is here today along with her \nmother, Becky Freidman and Bo's mother, Jenny Miller, didn't want \nother families to suffer as they did.  In their grief, they sought to give \nsome meaning to Beau's tragic death and suggested legislative action.   \nThis legislation requires institutions of Higher \nEducation to inform students, parents and guardians of their policies \non notification of a drug or alcohol violation, hospitalization, or \noverdose of a student under the age of 21.  It is our hope that this \nlegislation will foster communication and accountability among \nfamilies and institutions of Higher Education and that all parties will \nbe more informed about the responsibility to students in crisis. \nI offer my condolences to Jenny, Becky and Alexa on \nthe loss of their dear son, nephew and cousin and thank them for their \nadvocacy.  I also want to thank SUNY and CICU for their input into \nthis legislation.  In memory of Beau Miller and all those taken from us \ntoo soon from overdose, I proudly vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. McMahon in \nthe affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

So, I'm a little bit worried \nabout how this is all going to play out, but I will support the bill today \nand hope that it does not.  So, I'll be in the affirmative.

WALSH:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  So, some of \nyou might have been looking at the title of this bill and thinking, why \nwould you need a -- a workplace antiviolence policy to be developed \nfor libraries?  Aren't libraries just peaceful, quiet places?  But that -- \nthat is not the case.  It's -- it's interesting, you know.  Libraries, \nbecause they're free and open to the public, encourage some people to \ncome in and kind of hang out that don't really have a lot else to do and \nsometimes, those people, those folks, can create some problems with \nstaff and that -- that's an issue.  It's also and maybe you didn't know \nthis, it's -- it's a place where a lot of custodial changes take place.  So, \nif you've got warring parents and they need to exchange a child in a \ncustodial change, they'll use the libraries a lot and that can be a \nproblem.  That can create an unpleasant, or sometimes violent, or bad \nsituations.  \nSo, I really do think that this is necessary and I want \nto thank the sponsor for bringing it forward.  I think this is a good \nidea.  So, I'll be in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. Walsh in the \naffirmative.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n73Are there any other votes?

PHEFFER AMATO:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  \nOn October 7, 2022, FDNY Lieutenant Alison Russo, a supervisor \nparamedic, was brutally murdered while she was on duty.  Lieutenant \nRusso was in a uniform when her attacker fatally stabbed her multiple \ntimes in the neck and chest.  She was working alone and was waiting \nfor roadside assistance to come and repair her FDNY vehicle.  When \nshe waited, a civilian told her there was someone having a medical \nemergency.  She responded to investigate the report when the \nmurderer walked up to her and ended her life.  This bill is dedicated in \nher honor.  \nWhile EMTs and paramedics in New York City's \nFDNY work with partners, supervisors generally do not.  Yet, they are \nsubject to the same incredibly difficult working conditions and the \nsame serious dangers that EMT and paramedics face.  Our EMTs and \nparamedics are our street doctors and save lives every day.  Let's make \nsure they continue to be safe. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n75This bill would ensure that current protocols for \nstaffing levels for 911, EMT and paramedic ambulances are solidified \nto be two responders in each ambulance and ensures that supervisors \nworking in 911 EMS vehicles work in teams, just as EMTs and \nparamedics do.  \nGod bless all our EMTs and paramedics and may \nAlison's memory forever be a blessing.  I proudly vote in the \naffirmative.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Mr. -- Ms. Pheffer \nAmato in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

Roosevelt created it in 1931 to \nact as a counterweight to the power of private utilities like Con \nEdison.  And it's what the Build Public Renewables Act sought to do \nin 2023 when it authorized NYPA to lead the State's Renewable Build \nOut [sic].  However, we have seen since enactment of this law that \nwhat's often missing are the transparency and accountability measures \nthe public deserves in return for the unique power such authorities are \ngranted.  If authorities like NYPA are to be the people's corporations, \npublic participation needs to be a serious priority and this bill takes \nsome immediate steps in that direction. \nI will be voting in the affirmative.

WALSH:  Thank you very much, Madam \nSpeaker.  So, on this bill, it does a couple of things.  It -- it mandates \nthat State aid be fully disbursed to volunteer agencies that have \ncontracted with local government units within 60 days of the approval \nof such State aid and it specifically has to do with OASAS, that they \nwould have to dis -- disburse the full amount of State aid.  And I \nmean, it sounds good, but boy, I don't know if 60 days is really going \nto be enough time for them to be able to do that.  I have a little bit of a \nconcern about that.  And the second thing is it requires that volunteer \nagencies have to spend all State aid that they get within two years of \nreceiving the aid.  So, what I'm a little bit concerned about with that \nis, would that possibly encourage, or force, some not-for-profit \norganizations to perhaps overspend, just in order to spend down.\nSo, I'm -- I'm going to support the bill, but I just -- \nthose two things I wanted to just kind of put on the record I'm a little \nbit concerned about.  So, thank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMs. Walsh in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

To develop teamwork, to be part of something that's not \njust academics.  Not that academics aren't important because they are, \nbut I think sports really have their place and I just wanted to take the \nopportunity in responding to this bill, which I'm happy to support, to \nalso talk a little bit about kids who are home-schooled who really \nwould like to also be able to participate in sports and public school \nsports.  And one of our colleagues has a bill, A00389, to accomplish \nthat goal.  Many of us are -- are on as sponsors, or cosponsors and I \njust think that it deserves some consideration and I hope that in the \ncoming time, we could give it that consideration.  But, for now, I'm \nvery happy to support this bill.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Walsh in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

SANTABARBARA:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  This legislation establishes the New York State \nCommunication Bill of Rights for individuals with disabilities, \nmaking New York the first State in the nation to pass a bill like this.  \nIt affirms a simple truth; everyone deserves the right to be heard.  \nWhether through spoken words, typing, a letter board, communication \ndevice, or sign language, every person deserves to communicate the \nway it works best for them.  \nMy son was born with autism; he is non-speaking.  \nLike so many others, he communicates in ways that aren't always \nunderstood, but his voice, his thoughts, his feelings are just as real and \nmeaningful as anyone else's.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n99Earlier this week, we welcome -- welcomed to the \nChamber, Elizabeth Bonker.  She was here advocating for this bill.  \nShe's a national Disability Rights leader and Executive Director of \nCommunication 4 All.  She is non-speaking and communicates by \ntyping with the help of a device.  Her valedictorian speech at Rollins \nCollege typed through assistive technology, she reached millions \naround the world.  While she was here, she told us, non-speakers \nsuffer in silence.  We can free them.  I learned to type at age five and \nwas mainstreamed in public school.  She went on to say, with \ncommunication , non-speakers can be educated and productive  \nmembers of our society.  We are hopeless in silence and now , with this \nbill, we have the ability to have friends and tell our parents that we \nlove them.   That's what this legislation is about.  For too long, \ncommunication rights for non-speaking individuals have been \noverlooked, even with disability protections.  But this bill changes \nthat.  It puts the rights clearly into State law and makes sures -- makes \nsure that our schools, services providers, public programs, recognize \nand support every person's ability to communicate.  Elizabeth's words \nremind us what's at sake.  Connection, dignity, the ability to say \"I \nlove you\" to the people that matter the most.  And today, New York is \nleading the way. \nWith that, I cast my vote in the affirmative and \nencourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Santabarbara in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n100the affirmative.\nMs. Walsh to explain her vote. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Just \nimagine if you had all of these ideas in your head, all of these \nthoughts, all of these dreams, all these wishes, that you wanted to \nexpress and you couldn't express them.  Just think about how \nfrustrated you would be and that's, I think, what we're talking about \ntoday.  I'm so grateful that we are passing this bill today and I'm glad \nthat we're leading the way.  I know that there is some opposition, I \nknow that OPWDD is concerned about the cost here.  They're \nconcerned because they are saying that they should only have to pay \nfor proven services or clinically proven services, but, you know, like \nmy son -- my son's 32 now.  When he was a little boy, ABA, Applied \nBehavioral Analysis was not considered to be valid at that point.  It -- \nit was considered to be kind of controversial and now, that technique \nis used pretty much everywhere and it's -- and it's recognized as being \nimportant.  So, just as we've gotten to learn about -- I've learned and -- \nand we've all learned about autism and autism spectrum disorder and \n-- and any other disorder that results in a non-verbal individual, we \nhave to try to reach these individuals where they are and what a \nwonderful thing if through one of these treatment methods, these \neducational methods, we can open up their -- we can open up a -- a \nline of communication that they can use.  That is -- that is life- \nchanging at it's most fundamental and I -- I think it's worth a chance. \nAnd -- and so I'm just very grateful to be able to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                            JUNE 13, 2025\n101support this today.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Giglio to explain her vote. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker and I \nwould like to thank the sponsor for this bill.  You know, I had the \npleasure of meeting Elizabeth Bonker and Virginia Breen who \nactually wrote a book and the book is called, I Am in Here and when \npeople have a hard time communicate -- I mean, we all know \ncommunication is key, right?  So, being able to communicate through \nwhatever mechanism you can, will help you not only grow, but people \nwith unique abilities to flourish and to be able to have a career, have a \njob, do well in school, communicate with their family members and \nlive a good quality life.\nSo, it's a very important bill and it's a very good step \nin the right direction for people with disa -- with unique abilities that \nmay not be able to communicate with their voice and giving them \nother alternatives and helping them to explore those alternatives.  So, \nagain, I want to thank the sponsor for the bill.  It's a wonderful bill.  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Giglio in the \naffirmative. \nMs. Shimsky to explain her vote. \nMS.

So the quote for \nthe day is coming from my brother Muhammad Ali in his absence.  \nService to others is the rent you pay for your room to be [sic ] here on \nEarth.

But I have some cousins actually \ncame to visit today, Gregg and Anna Pasternack.  And they have been \nto the Capitol before but never in the Chamber.  And they actually are \ncoming from the Berkshires.  But their brother -- I'm sorry, Gregg's \nbrother recently passed away, Wayne Pasternack.

He recently \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n4passed very sadly, and he was a constituent of my colleague \nAssemblymember Shimsky.  He lived in Dobbs Ferry.  And I attended \nhis service, and all that really anybody talked about was what an \nincredible person Wayne was and how giving he was, and how he \nwould drive anybody anywhere to the end of the earth and back.  He \nwas an amazing sports fan, a phenomenal musician.  And I think that \nhis brother also shares many of those same qualities.  Gregg and his \nwife Deborah run a company called the Singing Classroom, a \nsubscription website that's a searchable database of songs, games, \nvideos and animations to help pre-K through 6 music teachers with \ntheir curriculum planning.

CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Thank you.  New \nYork State Assemblymember Monique Chandler-Waterman of \nAssembly District 58 and currently serving as a member of the New \nYork State [sic] Mental Health Committee. \nThis bill, A.4762-B, which -- which my office and I \nhave worked hard to advance in coordination with my in-district AD \n58 Mental Health Task Force, local and national advocates, \ncommunity leaders and fellow elected officials, is crucial.  According \nto the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly one in five adults in \nthe U.S., which comes to 57.8 million people, in 2021 experienced \nmental illness each year.  This is a public health priority, and \ndisregarding the impact of language surrounding it carries real \nconsequences -- compassion.  This bill ensures that New York's public \ninstitutions speak about mental health with respect, accuracy, and is \nperson-centered.  By replacing the outdated term \"emotionally \ndisturbed person\" with \"personal experiencing an emotional crisis\", \nthis will reflect our growing understanding of mental health and the \nimportance of language in shaping public's attitudes.  Words matter, \nespecially in government.  The change reduces stigma, promotes \ndignity, and aligns with best practices supported by the National \nHealth Organizations [sic], without affecting police operation, \ncriminal statutes or incurring new costs.  It's -- it's a simple but \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n10powerful step towards more humane and person-centered public \npolicy.  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Gandolfo.  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor please yield for just a couple of questions? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you.  So first, we had had \na conversation, I guess offline, about this bill and I appreciate some of \nyour clarifications.  I just want to put them on the record here.  \nSo, one of my concerns was the provision in here that \nany agency or municipality would have to replace any public-facing \nmaterials with materials that include this updated language.  If they \ncurrently have any manuals, any documents that use the term \n\"emotionally disturbed person\", would they have to throw those out \nand replaced them immediately or would this be on some kind of \nupdated schedule?  \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  No, they would \nnot have to replace it immediately.  They do have time.  This bill takes \neffect immediately, but it gives a year for the agencies to be able to \nupdate their materials as they would with any normal change. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n11MR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So one year and then \nafter a year any, you know, training materials just have to have this \nupdated terminology for their next release of the --  \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Yes. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for \nthat.  That relieves a lot of the burden that I thought would be on it.\nAnd another concern I had, which you had clarified \nand I just want to mention here for our colleagues, is that in Federal \nregulation there's not a definition of \"emotionally disturbed person\", \nbut there is a definition of an emotional disturbance that an individual \nmay possess.  And it's defined as something over the long-term.  It \nwould include conditions such as schizophrenia; however, I believe \nyour bill is more geared towards first responders and law enforcement \nwhen they're filling out a report to rather than refer to someone as an \nemotionally-disturbed person, to referring to them as a \"person \nexperiencing an emotional crisis.\"  So this is more for the reporting of \nfor first responders?  \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  This bill doesn't \nimpact how medical professional [sic] diagnose or treat patients, it \nsimply updates outdate -- outdated language on State and local forms, \ntraining materials that are publicly posted. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  And that would include \nlaw enforcement forms and, you know, if any EMS, if they fill out a \nreport to when they responded.  Like, forms such as that?  \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Just forms. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n12MR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  All right.  Thank you very \nmuch.  I appreciate your clarifications. \nMadam Speaker, on the bill briefly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  I appreciate the sponsor \nclarifying some of these things.  When I had started researching the \nbill and I came across the fact that there was a definition of emotional \ndisturbance in Federal regs, I had a concern that this might cause a \nconflict and lead to some imprecise language; however, after speaking \nwith the sponsor and hearing her responses here, I don't believe that to \nbe the case.  Because someone who is experiencing an emotional \ncrisis might not have an underlying emotional disturbance as defined \nin Federal regulation, and someone with an emotional disturbance \nmight not constantly be in a state of crisis.  \nSo I think the intent of this bill is good.  I think it \ndoes actually make the language more precise, especially when filling \nout a -- a report after a response.  So I -- I will be voting for this bill \nand I would encourage yes votes from my colleagues as well. \nThank you to the sponsor and thank you, Madam \nSpeaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  Will the sponsor yield for a question? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n13yield? \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  So, you mentioned that \nthis is going to impact the language that's used in most forms that \npeople have to fill out for whatever reason, as it relates to some level \nof government authority.  Is this also including the courts?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  No, this is just for \nthe agencies, update their outdated language. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Did you say agencies?  \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Mm-hmm.\nOkay.  Agencies and local municipal corporations. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Okay.  So that includes \nsocial service departments? \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Repeat that, \nplease?  \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Inclusive of social \nservice agencies?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Yes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Okay.  Thank you.  \nThank you very much.\nOn the bill.  I just want to mention --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n14MRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  I really do think this is \nan amazing idea to transform how we think about people and the \ncondition that they're in.  And it -- it brings me to yesterday's \nconversation on Mr. Hevesi's bill when I wondered, how did we get \nhere when there are so many dysfunctional families in our society.  \nThis may be one of the ways that we got here, by the harsh language \nthat we sometimes use that is not necessarily intended for every \nperson.\nSo I'm extremely impressed with the thought process \nof changing how we discuss this issue, and I think we may get to a \nbetter place with it as well.  So thank you, and I commend the sponsor \non this legislation. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect on the 365th \nday.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)\nMs. Chandler-Waterman to explain her vote. \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Thank you, \nMadam Speaker.  The implementation of this bill underscores the \nimportance of how we think about, feel towards, and respond to \npeople experiencing mental health crisis.  Language has the power to \nheal or to harm.  We, as humans, know that how a system talks about \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n15people is often how it treats them.  Shifting from emotional [sic] \ndisturbed to person experiencing an emotional crisis is not only \nperson-centered, it is trauma informed.  This terminology deescalates \npublic perception, particularly in police or emergency context, and \nrestores dignity to individuals in moments of vulnerability.  When we \nlabel someone as \"disturbed\" we distance ourselves from their \nhumanity.  When we say that they are experiencing a crisis, we invite \nempathy and action.  Ultimately, the way we talk about mental health \ncan either promote understanding or reenforce stigma, discrimination \nand exclusion.  \nAs we conclude, it is important to recognize that \nwords shape our thoughts and action, making today's focus on the \npower of language all the more vital.  I choose -- I choose to use \nlanguage as a tool to break stigmas and ultimately save lives. \nI will be voting in the affirmative and I encourage \neveryone here to vote as well.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Chandler- \nWaterman in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Madam Speaker, we can \ncontinue on our debates.  We're gonna take -- actually, we should \nadvance the A-Calendar first, please. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n16ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On Mrs. Peoples- \nStokes' motion, the A-Calendar is advanced.  \nMRS.

An act to amend the \nJudiciary Law, in relation to judicial departments.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Rivera. \nMR. RIVERA:  Thank you.  The State Constitution \nempowers the Legislature to adjust judicial districts including \nincreasing or decreasing their number, and altering their composition \nonce every ten years.  This allows for the reapportionment of justices \nwithin these altered districts.  The Legislature last exercised this \nauthority in 2007 when it established the 13th Judicial District in \nRichmond County.  This bill aims to make sure our elected judges \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n17genuinely reflect the diverse communities they represent.  Presently, \nexisting judicial district lines dilute the voices of various \ncommunities, preventing a representative Judiciary from being \nelected.  By drawing districts that accurately include and empower \ndiverse populations, we can cultivate a Judiciary that better \nunderstands and serves everyone, building greater public trust and \ndelivering more equitable justice. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Jensen. \nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe honorable gentleman from Buffalo yield for some questions? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Rivera, will \nyou yield?\nMR. RIVERA:  For the honorable gentleman from \nMonroe County, sure.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. JENSEN:  You're -- you're too kind, Mr. Rivera.  \nI appreciate it. \nI know you just talked a little bit about the process \nabout why we're doing this, a previous example of -- of when we last \ndid this and -- and utilized our role per the State Constitution.  But \ncould you delve into a little bit more about the justification  for \nbringing this now, maybe by expanding on the issues of diversity or \nequity that you -- you brought up in your explanation?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.  This is an issue that I have \nbeen looking at over the last few years.  Last year I proposed a similar \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n18piece of legislation that spoke to the 8th Judicial District where I live.  \nOther members have proposed similar ideas for the judicial districts \nthey lived in.  And as we know, this is something to be done once \nevery ten years, so collectively we came to the conclusion that it was \nwise to do it together.  At the end of the day we feel as though, \nespecially considering how long it's been since these lines have \nchanged and the nature of the changing population of these areas, that \nit was essential for us to consider whatever we could do to create a \nmore reflective judiciary in these -- in these regions. \nMR. JENSEN:  So when we talk about -- when you \ntalk about a reflective Judiciary, and with myself being a member of \nthe 7th Judicial District, which I think is the most affected part of this \nproposed legislation, and making it to your point more reflected, is \nthat -- is that based on race?  Is it based on gender?  Is it based on \npopulations from the communities that these individuals that currently \nserve on the Supreme Court are elected from?  What's -- what's, I \nguess, the biggest equity argument that you think is most compelling? \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  No, I mean, it -- it ranges.  So, \nfor example, you know, if we're looking at Monroe County, for \nexample, you know, the district as it currently stands is a little over 1.2 \nmillion people.  The substantial amount of that 1.2 million people, 61 \npercent, just live in one county; that's Monroe County.  Of that -- of \nMonroe County, it is the overwhelming center of not just population, \nbut of diversity.  For example, in -- in Monroe County the population \nof the -- of the entire sort of judicial district, 91 percent of the African- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n19American population in Monroe -- in -- in the judicial district is in one \ncounty; that's Monroe.  Eighty-seven percent of the Asian population \nof the entire judicial district is in one county; that's Monroe.  Almost \n80 percent of the Hispanic population of the entire judicial district is \nin one county; that's Monroe.  And as it stands right now, out of the 67 \njustices of the 4th Department, only two of them are African- \nAmerican.  None are Asian.  None are Hispanic.  And we feel as \nthough, you know, looking at those numbers in and of itself we see \nthat there's a correlation between the difficulty to have representation \nand sort of the drowning out of the bigger judicial district when so \nmuch of the population is concentrated into one county. \nMR. JENSEN:  So under that explanation, would it -- \nwould it surmise -- do you surmise that by specifically designing the \n7th Judicial District to wholly contain Monroe County, the 8th \nJudicial District to wholly contain Erie County, and the 14 -- the new \n14th Judicial District to wholly contain Onondaga County, that we \nwould see Supreme Court justices elected that reflect the -- the racial \nmakeups of those three counties specifically?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that the population \nreflects a higher probability -- well, let's see.  In the new maps there's \na higher probability that individuals that reside in those counties are \ngonna find themselves in front of a judge that -- that is from their \ncommunity.  We're focusing now on sort of the -- the ethnic/racial part \nof it, but the reality is also if you just look at my judicial district, for \nexample, the 8th Judicial District and Erie County is a over 900,000- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n20person county.  So more often than not, judges are elected from Erie \nCounty in the entire judicial district.  So now if I was a resident of \nOrleans County or Allegany County or Wyoming County, I would \nfind it difficult to find a judge from my county.  But under this new \ndesign, under these new boundaries, there's a much higher probability \nbecause Erie County is separate from the rest of those counties.  So \nright now, if I'm a resident of -- I'll just pick one -- for example, \nAllegany County, that from my understanding hasn't seen a Supreme \nCourt justice elected from that county since the early '80s, could now \nmean if I'm from Allegany County there's a higher probability that the \njudge that's in front of me is from my -- from my county, from my \ncommunity, knows my community. \nMR. JENSEN:  But doesn't -- so, understanding that \nthe -- the voters in each of the judicial districts elect the Supreme \nCourt justices from the judicial district, doesn't the O -- doesn't OCA \ndetermine where the Supreme Court judge is located?  So couldn't a \njudge elected out of Allegany County, to your point and your example, \nbe assigned to either another county within the same judicial district \nor an entirely different judicial district that OCA could assign \nsomebody from Allegany County to Suffolk County or to the City of \nBuffalo?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.  Under that scenario it's \nassuming that someone from Allegany has won an election -- well, has \ngotten the nomination, has been endorsed by whatever party they're \naffiliated with, has gone through their judicial convention, and got on \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n21the ballot and has won.  The problem is the fact that somebody from \nAllegany County hasn't been elected since 1981 means that that's not \nhappening.  So you're right in theory that OCA can put a judge here \nversus there.  But if a person's never elected to begin with, then OCA \nhas no (indiscernible/cross-talk).  \nMR. JENSEN:  But there's also -- but they could be \nelected from Allegany County or any of the other counties in these \nfive proposed JDs.  But there's no guarantee that they will actually \nhave their court based in the county from which they are elected -- \nthat they reside in. \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say OCA has broad authority \non a number of things. \nMR. JENSEN:  Speaking of OCA, have they weighed \nin on this proposal?  \nMR. RIVERA:  In the conversations I've had with \nOCA, they are fully in agreement that the issues that we see around \ndiversifying the Judiciary is something that they're fully aware of and \nit's something they wish to tackle. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Well, my -- my understanding \nis that they -- they have, I think today or earlier this week, did put out \n-- and whether it's from the Chief Judge -- Judge or another \nspokesperson for the -- the court -- that they said that acting on this -- \nI'm paraphrasing -- that acting on this today was not in OCA's best \ninterests, that they prefer it be delayed until next year to have further \nconversations, discussion and study about the implementation of any \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n22new JDs. \nMR. RIVERA:  I guess I'd have two points to that; \nfirst, the Constitution of the State of New York is clear.  It's the \nobligation of the Legislature to do this. \nMR. JENSEN:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. RIVERA:  We have the responsibility to do this \nonce every ten years, and we have not done this in quite some time.  \nSo -- so OCA might say, Yes, I would like to have taken part in some \nsort of conversation .  In reality, as I mentioned before, I had a bill on \nthis a year ago.\nMR. JENSEN:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. RIVERA:  Conversations with OCA happened \nthen.  I'm sure my Senate counterparts had conversations with OCA \non their side.  So it's -- it's not from out of left field, by any means.  \nWhat I would also say is, aside from it being our responsibility and \nour obligation, I'd also say, you know, I -- I tried with the best efforts I \ncould to try to determine, at least in the case of my judicial district, \nwhen the last time it was redrawn.  And I talked to, you know, \nattorneys and retired judges that go far back, to say it bluntly, a lot \nolder than you and I, and the conclusion that they all had with some of \nthem practicing law for 40, 50 years is that as long as they could \nremember, these lines looked this way.  So that means -- and some of \nthem assumed as far as back as it could have been this way, this exact \nsame setup, since the turn of the century.  So -- so taking into account \nhow much population changes and how much people move and -- and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n23what districts look like and simply what we've changed in the last 100 \nyears in this State, we -- we can't say that -- that now's not the right \ntime.  We -- we've missed the boat too many times to say, Oh, let's \njust wait another year. \nMR. JENSEN:  And certainly I can understand that \nand -- and you're certainly not gonna get an argument from me as \nsomebody who believes in our institution, the Legislature as an \ninstitution about utilizing every -- every arrow in our constitutional \nquiver when it's appropriate.  But I think -- I think it'd be a different \nconversation if we were up against a deadline where we -- we couldn't \nact because of a -- a set cutoff.  But with the most recent creation of a \njudicial district happening in -- in 27 -- 2007, there is no deadline that \nwe have to meet that -- you mentioned that you -- you introduced a -- \na standalone piece of legislation for the 8th JD.  I know one of my \ncolleagues did one for the 7th JD.  And so the conversations have led \nto the bill we have before us today.  But there is no statutory rush for \nus to not have larger discussions, especially with OCA and the \nresidents of the existing 5th, 7th and 8th judicial districts. \nMR. RIVERA:  I -- I would say it's in that absence of \na deadline or of a rush that has made it so that these districts have not \nchanged in both of our lifetimes put together.  So the change -- the \nabsence of a -- of a deadline or a rush has only left it the same way it's \nbeen for as long as many of us can remember.  And in reality, I feel \nstrongly that we're here, elected from the various districts we come \nfrom, to sort of move in a faster action than just sort of saying, Well, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n24it's always been this way and that's how it is.  I -- I think that we're \nhere to -- to bring forth a change, and if nothing else, to ensure that \nwhatever form of government is standing before a person it's -- it's \nmore better reflective of that community. \nMR. JENSEN:  And certainly I -- I don't have any \nargument on -- on that general statement. \nI want to get back to that in a moment, but just to \nfinish up on my OCA tangent.  Is there any fiscal cost attached to the \nthis legislation?  And if there is, is there any appropriation language \neither in this bill or a bill that we can expect to see before the end of \nthis year's Legislative Session to cover the cost of creating two new \njudicial districts?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that there are no new \ncreations of new judgeships.  There is not any speak -- there's no sort \nof a requirement of building new courthouses.  You know, counties \nhave courthouses in every county of this -- of this State.  I would say \nthat the -- the cost of this is gonna be deeply nominal.\nMR. JENSEN:  So -- \nMR. RIVERA:  No, go ahead.\nMR. JENSEN:  So -- so, deeply nominal.  The OCA \nestimates it's gonna cost about $9.6 million to create the two new \njudicial districts, which I -- I would agree that in a budget of $254 \nbillion, 9.6 million would be in that classification termed as nominal.  \nBut yet there is still a cost that the Judiciary Branch would have to \nincur, especially if these seats are gonna be up for election in 2026.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n25So I guess that's -- you know, I'm a little hesitant about proceeding \nwith a change where certain parts of this bill become effective \nimmediately without having appropriation outlays to ensure that \njustice can be heard, given, directed in a most expedient manner.  \nGoing back to the part about making sure that our \ncommunities have been heard, certainly we all do that here.  We're all \nrepresented by -- we all represent constituents.  A lot of legislation has \ncome up this year and it's -- it's been justified why we did it; because \nour constituents have been calling for it, interfacing.  Were there any \npublic hearings amongst the residents of the 5th, 7th or 8th judicial \ndistricts to get their feedback on this proposal or on the proposal of \nany new judicial districts in New York State?  \nMR. RIVERA:  You know, as per the State \nConstitution, it doesn't say that it's required, certainly.  That being \nsaid, I've had countless conversations with the most directly-affected \nsort of stakeholders, including OCA and -- and an array of judges.  So \nI -- I feel that everyone is in agreement that the -- the changes need to \nbe made in every conversation I've had.  And the only conversation \nthat I've had that's led people to sort of -- well, let me take a step back.  \nThe -- the intent of what we're doing here is universally sort of \nperceived to be the right thing to do.  Some people will say that the \ntiming is this or that.  But at the end of the day, like I said before, you \nknow, this has been far too long that it's been this way and, you know, \nwe're not on any other timeline other than the timeline of the need that \nwe see in front of us today. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n26MR. JENSEN:  Okay.  You know, certainly I -- I \nbelieve in, and you mentioned, and I think rightfully so, that before \nlegislation comes before us that the sponsor or the proponents are \nspeaking to stakeholders.  And I would argue that, yes, the existing \njudges who currently serve in these -- the three existing JDs, you \nknow, they would certainly have the need to weigh in.  The three \nexisting administrative judges would have a say.  Has there been a -- \nhave you had a conversation with the administrative judges from the \n5th, 7th and 8th JDs about how this change would impact their courts, \nas well as the judges and, more -- most importantly, the New Yorkers \nwho come to trial for whatever reason in those jurisdiction s?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I've spoken to administrative judges \nwithin -- I've spoke to an administrative judge in -- within OCA; yes, I \nhave.  \nMR. JENSEN:  So -- so just (indiscernible/ \ncross-talk).\nMR. RIVERA:  And he was of the thought that -- you \nknow, he also concurred with my position in that there is a diversity \nproblem in the bench.  I think that's universally accepted.  I mentioned \nthe statistic earlier of the 67 justices that are in the 4th Department, \nonly two of them are Black, and frankly, that's all in one county.  So \nthe overwhelming majority of -- of -- of this department does not have \na single person of color on the bench.  That's a problem for an \nenumerable set of reasons.\nMR. JENSEN:  Just -- just --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n27MR. RIVERA:  Hold on.\nMR. JENSEN:  I'm sorry.\nMR. RIVERA:  But at the same time, you know, your \n-- your take on, you know, how much conversation has existed \nbetween us and OCA, you know, like -- like I said before, it's our \nobligation, there's a reason.  In the State Constitution it's clear that it's \nour duty, it's our responsibility.  And to sort of broaden that to take in \nthe input of the Body itself that we are looking to sort of realign, you \nknow, I don't see why we would give up a space in our duty and \nresponsibility that we're elected to do to really anybody. \nMR. JENSEN:  Fair enough.  \nMoving into how certain specifics of this legislation \nwere decided, what was the -- the justification or the reasoning for \nassigning the judges from the three existing JDs into five JDs?  And \nnot talking about the -- the total number in each JD, but the actual \nspecific named judges.  Like, why would Jane Doe go from the 7th to \nthe 15th, but Jim Smith would go from the 7th to the 5th?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.  A couple things were taken \ninto account.  For example, one, we took into account the seniority \nand where they currently were assigned.  I think it's also important to \nnote that OCA has the authority to sit judges where they are, as you \nsaid before, and often they do that.  You know, we -- you know, \nwould also like to make that clear to everybody, that -- that as it \ncurrently stands, we took into account, you know, seniority and we \nalso took into account where that judge is located and feel that the end \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n28result is -- is, you know, fair to -- to all of those.  But at the end of the \nday the other thing to consider is who's occupying a judicial seat \ntoday, just much as any of us in this room who occupy our seats today, \nit -- it -- you know, our seats, my 104th Assembly District, must last \nmuch longer than I will.  And at the end of the day, you know, we \nmake decisions based on not on the individual, but on the -- on -- on \nthe district. \nMR. JENSEN:  I -- and I would agree with that.  You \nknow, whether it's a Supreme Court judge, a State Assemblymember \nor a village trustee, there's no guarantee that it'll be a certain -- a \nmember of a certain political party, that it'll be a certain gender, a \ncertain ethnicity.  Because at the end of the day it depends on who the \ncandidates are and who the voters choose to put their faith in to fulfill \nthe obligations of the job that they're seeking to fill.  So I would agree \nwith that. \nSo you talked about the judges are assigned based on \nseniority.  So you mean that it was based on the number of existing \nsenior judges who are now no longer in an elected seat but they've hit \nsenior status?  Are you talking about the judges who are approaching \nthe mandatory retirement age, or are you talking about longevity of \nservice on the bench in that role or in any judicial office?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I guess the starting point that I should \nhave mentioned before is that it's clear by our Constitution that there's \na maximum number of just -- justices spelled out, and it's 50,000 \nresidents per justice.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n29MR. JENSEN:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. RIVERA:  So that's sort of a starting point I \nshould have mentioned as well.  That's unaffected by this as well.  \nMR. JENSEN:  Mr. Rivera, I conceded that fact.  I \ndidn't --    \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah, yeah.  I wanted it mentioned.  \nSo the -- the question is what -- what was taken into \n-- into account?  \nMR. JENSEN:  Yeah.  So how were you -- you \nmentioned that one of the big things was seniority, and I just asked for \nclarification.  Was it trying to place judges who are in senior status \ninto the larger judicial population areas?  Was it looking at judges \nwho are getting close to this -- the -- the mandatory retirement age --\nMR. RIVERA:  No, no.\nMR. JENSEN:  -- into specific areas, or was it based \non total longevity of service on the Supreme Court bench or on the \njudicial bench at-large?  \nMR. RIVERA:  The latter. \nMR. JENSEN:  The latter.  Okay.  Thank you.  \nWere the -- and I know you mentioned you -- you \nspoke to one administrative judge.  I'm -- I'm guessing that was in the \n8th.  Was there any consultation with the five -- or not the five, the \nthree administrative judges on the assigning of judges across the new \nproposed five JDs? \nMR. RIVERA:  One of the concentrations that we did \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n30take into account is that we made sure that those that were Appellate \njudges stood in the same place.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.\nMR. RIVERA:  And if you're -- to the question of did \nI have conversations, I spoke to presiding judges of Appellates.  I've \nspoken to, as you can imagine, more judges in the last couple of \nweeks than I have in my whole life. \nMR. JENSEN:  See, I typically try not to talk to \njudges, but that's just normally --\nMR. RIVERA:  Same.\nMR. JENSEN:  -- I try not to talk to people with the \npower to send me to prison.\nMR. RIVERA:  My -- my number's out there, so --\nMR. JENSEN:  But that -- that's just by and large a \npersonal policy. \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I get it.\nMR. JENSEN:  Fair enough. \nYou mentioned that in the entire 4th Department \nthere's only two minority judges, two African-American judges.  And \nI -- forgive me, I don't know what judicial district they currently serve \nin. \nMR. RIVERA:  Eighth.  Solely in Erie County. \nMR. JENSEN:  Solely in Erie County.  Were they \nkept in the 8th Judicial District or were they assigned either separately \nor together to a new -- to the 15th JD? \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n31MR. RIVERA:  They were kept in the 8th. \nMR. JENSEN:  They were kept.  Okay, so the two \nAfrican-Americans judges were kept in the 8th District.  Okay. \nMR. RIVERA:  Right.  And truthfully, in the -- in the \nscenario of both of them, they're both Appellate judges.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.\nMR. RIVERA:  And all the Appellates are kept \ntogether. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Thank you.  And this is -- I'm \n-- I'm not a lawyer, I try not to play one. \nMR. RIVERA:  Me neither. \nMR. JENSEN:  It's great that we're -- we're probably \n--\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.\nMR. JENSEN:  -- the two most appropriate people to \nbe debating this.\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure, sure.\nMR. JENSEN:  But what would be the impact -- and \nin my unfamiliarity with the mechanisms of court cases, is there a \nconcern that a case that is currently being heard in a -- in a -- in one \nJD in a county that's now being assigned to a new JD, could cause a \ndisruption in the proceedings of an ongoing case -- and certainly, \nsome cases can last for years -- that it could still be heard or in the \nprocess of being heard upon the full implementation of this law?  \nMR. RIVERA:  So -- so, you know, no -- no judge \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n32that's currently sitting a judge -- as a judge today is -- is, you know, no \nlonger gonna be a judge because of this.  So their caseload, their --  \nwhatever things that they're working on are unchanged. \nMR. JENSEN:  So if -- if a -- if a court -- and we've \n-- we've mentioned Allegany County a couple of times --\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.\nMR. JENSEN:  -- so I'm gonna -- I'm gonna reference \nthat Allegany County is currently in the 8th JD, correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. JENSEN:  Correct.  So in Allegany County \ntoday is -- you know, a case may be brought before a Supreme Court \njudge sitting in Allegany County.  Their case is being heard and it's \nbrought and, you know, the opening motions are brought in the 8th.  \nThen by the time it goes to trial, it's -- now the time frame has passed \nand we're now in full implementation of this law, and now they're \nbeing heard in the 15th JD but the judge who's hearing the case has \nnow been assigned into the new 8th District.  Would that provide any \nsort of hardship or grounds for a dismissal or a -- a mistrial?  Is there \nany judicial issues that could arise?  \nMR. RIVERA:  None.  None.  I mean, at the end of \nthe day they're all still within the 4th Department, so that's one part of \nthat.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.\nMR. RIVERA:  And the second thing is as long as -- \npresumably, unless that judge retires or which would happen with or \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n33without this, it would be the same judge that would see the same case.  \nThat -- that wouldn't matter. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Certainly you referenced one \nof the considerations being population, and certainly, unfortunately, \nfor our representation in the Federal Government, Western New York \nand the Finger Lakes have seen a -- a decrease in population.  While \nMonroe County as a whole may have seen a population increase, our \nregion as a whole has saw a -- a reduction.  \nNot just looking at issues of -- of diversity makeup or \nthe -- the population at-large, was there a weighing of existing \ncaseloads out of each county when assigning counties to specific JDs?\nMR. RIVERA:  The -- I didn't want to touch anything \naround caseloads, in part because what's -- what the -- you know, \nwhatever the burden of caseloads is today is different from a year from \nnow and two years from now.  That's a moving target that, you know, \nyou don't -- you don't make a long-term decision like this, something \nwe can only do once every ten years, based on today's caseload.  It \nwouldn't be reflective of -- of really much in the grand scheme of \nthings. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.\nMR. RIVERA:  And although it's ten years, take into \naccount that these are -- these are individuals that have to run for 14- \nyear terms, so it's -- it's even -- they have all the more time is what I'd \nsay to that. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Looking at population of the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n34new proposed judicial districts, the largest would be the 8th, which is \nErie County with approximately -- 2024 estimates have a population \nright around 950,000, yet the population of the smallest proposed \njudicial district is the 14th in Onondaga with just under 490 -- \n470,000, a difference of almost 4 -- 481,000 New Yorkers.  \nMR. RIVERA:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. JENSEN:  Is there a concern that you have about \nthe way these judicial districts were determined where you have such \na dramatic population difference in -- in the same region?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I -- I would say no.  I -- I would say, \nyou know, number one, in 2007 when we did this with Staten Island it \nactually had a smaller population than the county of Onondaga.  So \nthere's precedent for the number.  The other thing I'd say is that, you \nknow, the idea here is we're -- there -- there are population centers \nthat are, you know, that -- that dominate the entire population of their \ncounties, and those counties dominate the population of their judicial \ndistricts.  So by isolating that County of Onondaga and Monroe and \nErie, it makes it so that those other towns that -- that are on the \noutskirts or -- or those other counties that have towns in the -- in the \noutskirts of Monroe, Onondaga and Erie have now a better likelihood \nof -- of, you know, electing judges from their counties. \nMR. JENSEN:  And I -- I can understand that, and -- \nand going down that -- that line of reasoning.  You know, certainly \nBuffalo being the -- the State's second-largest city, Rochester being, \nunfortunately the fourth, Syracuse I think fifth at this point.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n35MR. RIVERA:  Sounds about right. \nMR. JENSEN:  Why wasn't Westchester County \nincluded in this legislation?  Certainly the City of Yonkers is the third- \nlargest city in New York State.  They have a large population center, \nto your point you just made.  Why -- why didn't you look at separating \nWestchester County from the rest of their judicial district in a similar \nfashion than you did for Erie, Monroe and Onondaga? \nMR. RIVERA:  By our estimates -- well, for a couple \nof reasons.  You know, one, as I mentioned before, these were the \ninitial bills that we had and kind of this is what we've been running \nwith.  But also, the population shifts that we've seen in the Western \nNew York, sort of Upstate Western New York region, has \ndemonstrated greater shifts than that neck of the woods. \nMR. JENSEN:  And -- and I understand that, to your \npoint you just made and was made earlier about existing legislation \nthat would create a 14th JD, two separate 14ths for Erie and Monroe.  \nBut there was no pre-existing, that I'm aware of, legislation for \nOnondaga.  So the decision was made to add a third county to whole \n-- be wholly contained in a judicial district.  So under that same logic, \nWestchester and the diversity, and I believe they have see growth in \npopulation, that they may have been appropriate to create their own \njudicial district as a standalone and allow for greater representation \nfrom the other counties in that judicial district. \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I mean, truthfully, I can only \nspeak to the bill in front of me, and whether another bill is introduced \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n36in the future for other counties, that's, you know, for the future to see.  \nBut also, you know, the -- the -- there's a glaring issue around not just \nthe diversity of a county, but then the representation of that diversity \non the bench.  And we see that being a much starker problem in \nOnondaga, Monroe and Erie. \nMR. JENSEN:  So that's your -- the belief is, and -- \nand I don't have -- you've certainly done a tremendous amount of \nresearch into this, and -- and I -- I recognize that and can't -- can't \ndisagree with that.  So you see the larger diversity issues as being \nmore prevalent in Erie, Monroe and Onondaga than in any other \nlocations in New York State that don't already have a standalone \njudicial district.  For instance, Westchester.\nMR. RIVERA:  The population numbers are what \nthey are, and they show what they show us. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Fair enough.  \nI think one of my colleagues is probably gonna touch \non this more, and I know I'm short on my -- on my second 15.  Are \nthere any other areas of State law that rely on the judicial districts to \nfulfill the statutory terms of State law?  \nMR. RIVERA:  As you're probably aware, judicial \ndistricts also -- the conversation around judicial districts also come \ninto account when we talk about the Board of Regents. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  And I'm sure I'll have a \ncolleague who will delve into those questions more at length. \nBut Mr. Rivera, I appreciate our -- our robust \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n37conversation on this topic and I appreciate our colleague's \ngraciousness in -- in listening to our loquaciousness.  \nMR. RIVERA:  Thank you. \nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Tannousis.  \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWill the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, of course. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  You hesitated a little bit. \nMR. RIVERA:  For you, never. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Okay.  Thank you.\nMr. Rivera, I -- you mentioned diversity quite a few \ntimes in your -- in your debate thus far.  Can you please define for us \nwhat diversity is?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, I read earlier around some of \nthe numbers and I used my judicial district for an example.  I have \nsimilar numbers around ethnic diversities and -- and the population \nreflected in each county and each judicial district by comparison.  But \nI'd also say, you know, it -- it goes past that.  I mean, I mentioned a bit \nearlier in that -- I used Allegany as -- as an example but I'll use \nanother county.  You know, for example, Steuben.  Steuben, the  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n38likelihood of a person, you know, being elected from Steuben County \nas it currently sits is difficult because Monroe County is the \npopulation center.  It's the, by far, more so than any other county in \nthe judicial district, and it makes it that much more difficult for \nsomebody that's from a Steuben or a Livingston or an Allegany or a \nWyoming, to -- to become a Supreme.  So it -- it's diversity in the way \nthat I said before.  As, you know -- you know, as -- as a -- as a Latino \nperson myself, I have yet to meet a Supreme Court judge from the 4th \nDepartment of my ethnicity.  I know that there's future and there's \nprogress and we see that, and I hope that that will be different one day.  \nBut I also say if I'm a resident of Steuben County, I -- I look at it and I \nsaid, Well, what's the probability  that I'm ever gonna see a judge from \nmy county in the Supreme Court when Monroe is such the big \npopulation  base and the majority of judges come from Monroe \nCounty?  So now under this scenario, so many more counties are on a \nway more level playing field because there's not this heavy, big county \nlike Erie or Monroe is and their -- and their judicial districts.  Now \nthere's gonna be more opportunity for folks that just as much as I don't \nsee somebody that -- that -- that I say is from my community on the \nJudiciary, someone from Steuben County, regardless of their ethnicity, \nfrankly, cannot say that they often see someone from their county \nrepresented in the Supreme Court. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  So just to be clear, when you're \nspeaking about diversity, you are most certainly speaking about race; \nis that correct?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n39MR. RIVERA:  I just gave you an example that it \nwasn't. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Well, no, you kind of gave us an \nexample that it was, because you just mentioned the fact that you are \nHispanic -- of Hispanic background, and you just said that the chances \nof seeing a judge of the same ethnicity as you --\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.\nMR. TANNOUSIS:  -- was slim to none.  Isn't that \nwhat you just said, Mr. Rivera?  \nMR. RIVERA:  As much as I said about the average \nvoter in Steuben County. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Now, do you believe that the \nresidents of these counties, do you think that they're interested in \nseeing people of the same ethnic makeup as potentially them, or are \nthey more interested in seeing actual fair judges that will make the \nright decisions?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, I think we're able to \naccomplish both. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  I noticed, Mr. Rivera, you didn't \nreally touch upon about backlog at all.  So is it fair to say that backlog \nwas not looked at at all when preparing this bill?  \nMR. RIVERA:  As I said before, I mean, I'll -- I'll \nlump the conversation around backlog in the same way I lumped the \nconversation around current caseload.  It's -- it's reflective of a \nmoment in time, not reflective of the needs of the whole department.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n40You know, this is something that -- that is a multi-year, long-term \nthing, and we'd do a disjustice [sic] if we're just focusing on today's \ncaseload. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Okay.  So then just to confirm, I \njust want the record to be clear.  \nMR. RIVERA:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Backlog was not taken into \naccount in preparation for this bill, correct?  It is just diversity, as you \njust stated. \nMR. RIVERA:  The number of judges based on \npopulation already takes into account the processing of cases. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  So the answer is no, right, Mr. \nRivera?  \nMR. RIVERA:  It's what I just said. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  It's a -- it's a very simple yes or \nanswer.  It's either you did or you didn't. \nMR. RIVERA:  I -- I gave you my answer.  If you \ndon't like it -- \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Thank you.  \nLet's talk about the judges that are now present that \nwill be affected by this.  These are judges that were elected within \ncertain judicial districts, correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  All of these judges were elected in \ntheir judicial districts, yes.  \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  And when we say elected in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n41their judicial districts, they were on the ballot.  Voters from those \nparticular districts that they ran went to the ballot box and voted and \nexpressed their desire to see these people on the bench in their district; \nis that correct, Mr. Rivera?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Just like folks that vote for us. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Correct.  And now as a result of \nthese bills some of these folks will no longer be in those particular \njudicial districts; correct, Mr. Rivera?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Just as much as when we get \nredistricted, we face the same situation. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Well, not exactly.  Right, Mr. \nRivera?  Because I have not been told that I now represent a \ncompletely different district than I currently have, and I'm assuming \nthat hasn't happened to you either, Mr. Rivera, has it?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Thank you.  \nMr. Rivera, you mentioned conversations that you \nhad with the Office of Court Administration.  Have you received any \ntype of memo or paperwork in support with regards to this bill \ncurrently from the Office of Court Administration? \nMR. RIVERA:  Nor have I received a letter of \nopposition. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  But you -- we did, however, \nwere informed by the Office of Court Administration that they would \nlike this bill to wait until next year to allow for further discussion and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n42analysis; isn't that correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  That could be their will, but at the \nend of the day it's the same districts that we've had for longer than \nanyone can, you know, can remember in -- in the 4th Department.  \nAnd waiting another year, kicking the can, seems unprudent [sic] in \nthe face of what we know to be a problem. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Well, Mr. Rivera, the Office of \nCourt Administration, you would agree, that this is the Body that runs \nthe courthouse, correct?  That manages the courthouse, manages the \nstaff, manages the finances for these court systems; isn't that correct? \nMR. RIVERA:  But we are the Body that the \nConstitution calls upon to do this. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  But we are not the Body that \nactually directly manages the courthouses throughout New York State, \ncorrect?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I suppose I would say we, as the \nLegislature, not only determine the districts and what they look like, \nwe, as the Legislature, approve a budget.  We, as the Legislature, do \ncountless things around the Judiciary. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Do we manage the courthouses \naround this State on a daily basis like the court -- Office of Court \nAdministration does?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  And that's what the court of -- \nthe Office of Court Administration does, correct?  That is their \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n43purpose?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  So you would agree that they \nwould be in the best possible situation to know if they -- a bill such as \nthis should go through this year, or perhaps maybe wait for a later date \nfor various reasons?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I generally think the independent \nnature of what we did was the wiser thing to do.  And that's why the \nConstitution is clear that it is us that makes that decision, not OCA. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Mr. Rivera, are you -- are you \ntelling us today that you know more than the Office of Court \nAdministration that manages the -- all these courthouses, including \nthis particular courthouse that will be affected?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that the wise people that \nmade the language, what it is in the State Constitution, took into \naccount the justices of their day just as much as we're taking the \njustices of our day. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Okay.  So I believe, then, I \nwould take that as a yes.  You believe that you know better than the \nOffice of Court Administration. \nMR. RIVERA:  I know better than to say that. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  The Onondaga City Bar \nAssociation, are you familiar with them, Mr. Rivera?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Can't say I am. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Do you -- do you know that they \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n44have put forth an opinion stating that this bill would cause operational \ndysfunctions -- disruptions, I apologize, significant financial costs and \npotential barriers to justice.  Are you aware of that?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say waiting another year \nwouldn't have changed that position. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Okay.  But that was -- that was \nthe Bar Association that made that -- that made their feelings known. \nOther questions, Mr. Rivera. \nMR. RIVERA:  And -- and just to mention --\nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Yeah, of course.\nMR. RIVERA:  -- I've spoken to Bar Associations.  I \nhave -- and I have gotten the same pushback.  And frankly, Bar \nAssociations don't make determinations on where judges sit. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  But Bar Associations are made \nup of attorneys that practice in this courthouse; wouldn't you agree?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say I have a letter of support \nfrom the Trial Lawyers Association.  So those are attorneys, too, that \nare supportive of it. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Well, who would know better \nabout this particular courthouse, the Onondaga City Bar Association \nthat actually is full of attorneys from this county, or associations \npotentially from -- made up of attorneys from other counties?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say I have the full confidence \nthat what we've done, what's on paper, this bill, is going to be \nreflective of the will of -- of these communities and the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n45representatives that represent them. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Another question for you, Mr. \nRivera.  Was LATFOR consulted in terms of making up these judicial \ndistricts?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Can you say that again?  I'm sorry. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  LATFOR. \nMR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Okay.  Was there any type of \neither bipartisan entity or independent entity that was consulted in \nregards to the drawing of these particular judicial districts?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say honestly, between all the \njudges that I've spoken to in the -- in the building up to this point, I'm \nsure there were multiple parties, and frankly, I never asked any of \nthem what party they're affiliated with.  But I would say yes, I have \nconsulted with people from both Democrats and Republicans. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Oh really?  Well, let's -- let's go \ninto those groups, then, if you have.  Which independent groups or \npeople did you consult with in coming up with this type of legislation?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No, what I said is I spoke to judges \nthat reflect multiple parties. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Oh, you spoke to judges.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yes.\nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Okay.  Did you speak to any \ntype of independent group or good government group in relation to \nthese judicial seats?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n46MR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Okay.  \nMR. RIVERA:  And frankly, this bill -- the -- the \ninitial version of this bill has been out for the public's viewing for over \na year, and the only feedback I had ever gotten was the deep \nunderstanding that -- that -- that there are necessary changes needed. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Well, Mr. Rivera, I just \nmentioned at least two entities, including the Office of Court \nAdministration which directly manages the -- the structures and the \npersonnel that are involved in this, and the Onondaga City Bar \nAssociation which is made up of attorneys that practice in -- at this \nlocation, and I've expressed deep reservations that they have expressed \nin regards to this bill.  So are you stating that you -- beside -- you -- \nyou have not heard of any other type of reservations in regards to the \n-- to this bill?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  And did you hear from those \ntwo entities?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Did you have conversations with \nany of those -- with either of those two entities?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, wait.  OCA?  Yes, of course. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  You had -- did they explain that \nto you?  \nMR. RIVERA:  They explained to me that they see a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n47need for a change.  They know that there's a problem.  They've done \nestimates and conversations with countless, you know, members of -- \nof the 4th Department and they know that there's a problem.  Where \ntheir concern is is around timeline, but not on the substance of what \nwe're doing. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  I see.  So they did express to you \nthe desire to not pass this this year and push it a little bit further down \nfor -- for various reasons, correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  You said it yourself in a statement \nthat -- that you read earlier.\nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Thank you so much.  Thank \nyou, Mr. Rivera.\nOn the bill, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. TANNOUSIS:  Madam Speaker, the sponsor \nhas made it very clear that the only reason for the change of judicial \ndistricts in -- in the words that he has put forth are in regards to \ndiversity.  But I submit to this Body that the colors here involved have \nnothing to do with race.  It has -- has to do with Democratic blue or \nRepublican red.  Those are the colors that this piece of legislation has \nto do with.  He has admitted himself that he has -- was given various \nreservations by groups in regards to this piece of legislation, including \nthe Office of Court Administration who, by the way, would probably \nbe in the best possible position to know if this bill is actually feasible \nto pass this year.  They have made it clear that it is not feasible, it \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n48should not be passed this year.  But yet here we are, because certain \nmembers of this Body believe they know best.  They know better than \nOCA.   \nI am against this bill and I advise my colleagues to \nvote against it as well.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Maher.  \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you.  So this bill creates -- \n(indiscernible) to create two new judicial districts within the 4th \nJudicial Department.  I just had a couple of questions for you. \nMR. RIVERA:  Sure. \nMR. MAHER:  When it comes to the cost in the \nbudget, can you go over what we have in this currently adopted budget \nand what -- potentially what we're thinking the shortfall is in terms of \ntotal cost?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, I guess, number one, it doesn't \ntake effect until '27 so there's no shortfall for '26.  What I'd say is there \nis no creation of new judge -- judicial spots.  You know, there's no \nnew judges being -- no judgeships being created.  So we believe that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n49the cost is quite nominal.  I heard a figure spoken earlier; I disagree \nwith it.  We're gonna have to address it at the right time. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  We did a little bit of research, \nmy team and I, and we were looking at other areas around the State \nand around the country which may or may not be comparable.  But \njust so you have them, anywhere from 1- to 1.5 million for transition \nIT costs; ongoing operations, potentially another 1 million a year.  \nAnd then really where it gets interesting is if there are any courts that \nneed infrastructure improvements.  In your delib -- deliberations going \nover this bill, did you run into any conversations where there might \nactually by some physical issues with the buildings or rehab to the \nbuildings in terms of this transition?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I have the full confidence that OCA \nis gonna be able to manage, as they already do, in those court -- in \nthose spaces.  There -- there is not a need to build new courthouses.  \nThere's -- it's just a matter of allocating judges to certain places. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  There were some concerns -- \nMR. RIVERA:  I'd also say, you know, OCA has a \nbudget of approximately $3 billion, and this is a legislative Body, \nfrankly, that wants to support that and has always done so and will \ncontinue to do so. \nMR. MAHER:  Since you bring up the number of 3 \nbillion, do we know typically year by year what the use of that 3 \nbillion is?  Is there a bit of an issue with spending all three?  Is it to \nthe T?  Is it operational mostly?  Is there really that much wiggle room \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n50in that number?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that's in the budget that's \nbefore us every year.  I don't have that off the top of my head. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  All right.  I'm curious.  You \ngot me curious now.  Okay.\nSo, another issue that's been brought up is disruptions \n-- the potential of disruptions to court personnel and the legal process \nwhen it comes to redistricting, potentially leading to staff \nreassignments and really the caseload in general.  Were there any \nissues with the potential caseload brought up during the discussion of \nthis bill?  \nMR. RIVERA:  As I said before, to -- to take into \naccount caseload would not be the proper sort of variable in it all.  \nWhat I'd also say is where there's greater population there's more cases \nand, therefore, more judges.  That doesn't change.  That's how it is \ntoday.  If there's a caseload problem today, this wouldn't affect it \ngoing up or down tomorrow.  So caseloads are just caseloads. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  So you don't think this will \npotentially have a negative impact on caseloads during the transition?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No, it's the same judges, it's the same \nstaff, presumably.  It's --  \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Thank you for that answer. \nWhen it comes to -- bear with me one minute.  \n(Pause)\nWhen it comes to certain types of cases, housing, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n51family court, same question.  Do -- do you envision any sort of issues \nwith the creating of -- of potential justice deserts because there are \nissues with the transition on those specific housing and family court \ncases?  \nMR. RIVERA:  This is solely dealing with Supreme \nCourt.  So village courts, town courts, county courts, family courts are \nnot affected. \nMR. MAHER:  Awesome.  Thank you.\nYou answered my active cases.  You answered my \nfunding questions.  Oh, when it comes to data that was being \npresented, what sort of data was used?  I know you -- you talked about \nthe disparities, which I think are -- are legitimate in terms of the racial \nequity aspect of this.  What other data-driven framework was created \nwhen drafting this bill?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say the majority of \ninformation is just from the Census.  You know, the population of \nparticular counties, the populations of judicial districts.  That's all \ndirectly from the Census without, you know, yeah. \nMR. MAHER:  All right.  Well, we appreciate you \nanswering our questions.  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor.  Appreciate it.\nMR. RIVERA:  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Sempolinski. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Would the sponsor yield for \nsome questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n52yield?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  In an earlier question you \nmentioned a couple counties with which I am familiar, Allegany and \nSteuben.  Did you consult with the representative for Allegany County \nwhen constructing this bill?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  No?  Who is the \nrepresentative for Allegany County?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I got a sense. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  That's right.  Did you consult \nwith any of the Steuben County Delegation when constructing this \nbill?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  No.  So you're making \ndecisions about our counties, assuming what perhaps we might like or \nprefer as far as the State court system without talking to us. \nMR. RIVERA:  You know, I would -- you know, \ncorrect me if I'm wrong, but if I'm an Allegany resident or a Steuben \nresident or a Chemung resident or a fill-in-the-blank county resident -- \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Chemung is not in the 4th \nJudicial Department.\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct.  I'm just using it as an \nexample.  But if I'm of any -- if I'm a resident in any county, the -- the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n53-- the higher probability of me being in front of a judge from my \ncounty is a positive.  And I think that's what this will do. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I -- I think maintaining the \nintegrity of the court system is more positive than whether my \nparticular county or any particular county gets a judge.  I'm more \nconcerned about that.  But maybe you have a different feeling. \nMR. RIVERA:  But if it's the same judges, then \nwhat's the (indiscernible)?  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Well, I --I have some broader \n--\nMR. RIVERA:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk).\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  -- concerns which I'm gonna \nget into. \nMR. RIVERA:  Okay. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  First of all, I just wanna \nclarify -- you did say this for some of my colleagues -- there are \ncurrently 67 judges in these three judicial departments.  At the end, \nwe're gonna have five judicial departments with 67 judges.  There's \nnot a change, an increase or a decrease in the number of judges?  \nMR. RIVERA:  The 67 is the department.  So yes, \nthat number doesn't change. (Indiscernible/cross-talk).  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So the number of judges \nthroughout the department -- \nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  -- is the same?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n54MR. RIVERA:  Correct.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  The date of effect we talked \nabout a little bit, it will be next year, and as was mentioned -- and -- \nand I'm looking at the sponsor's memo, and in the sponsor's memo, \nthese are your words, correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Yes.  It says the last time that \nthe Legislature actually exercised their authority was 2007 to change \nthese lines.  And you state that the -- the leg -- the Constitution \nauthorizes the Legislature to make these changes.  It does not require \nthem to make those changes.  Am I interpreting your words correctly?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  That's correct. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Right.  So unlike the State \nLegislature or unlike Congress, we are obligated to change or redo the \nlines after every Census.  Your words say we are authorized, and I \nthink that is a correct interpretation of the Constitution.  We don't \nhave to exercise that authority, and in this case it has not been \nexercised in some time. \nMR. RIVERA:  And just -- it -- it's not that I'm saying \nwe're authorized, the State Constitution says we're authorized. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I would -- I would concur \nwith that assessment.  Why do you think it's different between judges \nand between the Legislature, as opposed to a requirement as opposed \nto an authorization? \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, that's interesting.  I mean, I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n55suppose the terms are drastically different.  Like, the length of time \none serves is 13 years for -- for -- I'm sorry, 14 years for -- for \nSupreme and our terms are two years.  I'd also say like the biggest \ndifference when it comes to redistricting us versus judicial districts is \nthat the State Constitution is clear that the judicial districts cannot \ndivide counties.  So it has to be entire counties, wherein the case of \nyour district, my district and all of our districts, it can be broken down \nto a village line, a county line, a town line, a city line, a counciled \nline, a legislature line.  So there is far more, you know, you know, fine \npoints to our redistricting because we don't have the parameter of \nbeing county only.  So there's simply just more complexity to our \ndistricts because we don't have that restriction. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.\nThere was some mention -- I wanna just hit one point \non how judges are allocated.  The judges are allocated by name, based \non the current occupants of that particular seat and they're allocated \nacross the five different judicial districts that are contemplated in this \nbill, correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So, and you said what was \ntaken into account was seniority, geography, those sort of things.  Was \npartisanship taken into account?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Not at all. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I -- I was curious, because I \nwent to see who would be the judges in the judicial district where I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n56would reside and that I would represent, and all the folks that were \nallocated, all the ones that wouldn't age out before their term were \nRepublicans.  So are you saying that's just a coincidence? \nMR. RIVERA:  I'd say that in the case of the 8th \njudicial -- or the -- the new district, I would say that factors are taken \ninto account like seniority, whether they were Appellate, and then \ntaking into account, you know, where they currently reside.  For \nexample, I know that there's a judge in Chautauqua County, Judge \nHanlon --\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Correct.  Grace Hanlon, yes.  \nMR. RIVERA: -- who is a resident of Chautauqua \nCounty, a Democrat --\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  She is a Democrat, correct.\nMR. RIVERA:  And she's gonna be located in the \nnew district. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  And -- and she'd be one that \nwouldn't be up for reelection, though.  Her age would -- \nMR. RIVERA:  Surprisingly, that was the case with \nan overwhelming majority of these judges, that they're --  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Well, a 14-year term, that \ndoes happen.  So my --\nMR. RIVERA:  Not much I could do about that.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So my overarching \nphilosophical concerns with this is this appears to be a judicial \ngerrymandering.  Do you fear that injecting gerrymandering such as \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n57we've had be a source of great controversy in State legislative and \ncongressional elections, so much so that the people put on to the \nConstitution an anti-gerrymandering provision relatively recently, \ninjecting that type of action into the court system undermines faith in \nthe courts?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that when we have the \nconversation around gerrymandering it -- it -- it's not exactly close to \nthis subject because we're not dividing municipalities.  We're not \ndividing communities.  We're just keeping entire counties whole.  So I \ndon't think it's the same thing. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Well, you're drawing \nparticular districts for particular purposes.  And -- and I'm -- again, \nyou said the sponsor's memo is your words.  You said the bill is \ndesigned to remedy the inequality -- and you referred to specifically \nracial inequality -- you're drawing districts for that particular purpose, \nyour words.  Is that not a gerrymander?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No, I don't think -- \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  How is that not a gerrymander \nif you're drawing particular districts for a particular purpose?  \nMR. RIVERA:  It would be gerrymandering if I \ndecided to cut the County of Erie in half, split it up some way.  \nBecause that's the population center where there's the most diverse \npopulations.  We're not doing that in any county. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  You can draw a gerrymander \nwithout drawing weird districts if you draw it for a particular purpose.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n58How it looks, whether it's a snake or -- or some sort of squiggle or \nsomething is irrelevant.  It's -- you are drawing it for a reason other \nthan good justice. \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that I'm confident in the \n67 judges that we have before us and they are delivering justice.  None \nof them are changed.  So... \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Because the people \nthemselves are not changed you feel it's not a gerrymander, even \nthough you're changing how all future judges will be selected?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that there is a process \nthat's been set in place by the State Constitution that we, as a Body, \nhave not taken up in this region for -- from, half jokingly, what I've \nheard is almost a century.  I would say that it is --  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Is that not a source of \nstability, though?  Isn't that a positive that we haven't changed judicial \ndistricts?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I don't think that that's -- stability is \nnot the priority when we're talking about representation.  I would say \nthe -- \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So your goal is \nrepresentation?   \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say that --\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Just to be clear, your goal is \nrepresentation.\nMR. RIVERA:  I'll get to my point.  What I would \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n59say is that the neighborhood, the city, the town, the whatever you live \nin, looks drastically different than what it looked like, we'll say 70 \nyears ago, which is probably even further back.  So why we would \ncontinue to move and operate under the idea that things look the same \nway they looked at almost a century ago is -- is never gonna be okay. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So your -- again, your goal is \nrepresentation so that folks look like the folks that are -- that -- the \ndistricts that they're coming from. \nMR. RIVERA:  As it should be, yes. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  As it should.  Okay.  I would \nsay when we're talking about the Legislature, the goal is \nrepresentation.  When we're talking about the judicial system, the goal \nis justice.  But that's just me. \nElection Law -- \nMR. RIVERA:  Just to be clear.  There's not -- the \nidea of representation and justice are not diametrically opposed.  That \ncan exist simultaneously. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  My -- the --the overarching \ngoal of the judicial system is justice is my supposition.  \nElection Law.  Recently there are new statutes for \ncertain Election Law actions have to be brought in New York County, \nAlbany County, Westchester County, and Erie County.  With one of \nthose jurisdiction s being impacted, would that not lock in, potentially, \nsince Erie County is an overwhelmingly Democratic jurisdiction , \nElection Law matters in Erie County being determined by Democrats?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n60And by the way, the other three jurisdiction s are also overwhelmingly \nDemocratic. \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say what matters are before \nwhat courts was never something I took into account in any way. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  My final question is, you \nmentioned that this bill has been in the works for some time.  I found \nout about it yesterday morning, personally.  But it's been in the works \nfor some time, different versions.  I know there was a 7th Judicial \nDistrict version, there was an 8th Judicial District version.  If it's been \nin the works for some time, why didn't it go through any hearings or \nthe proper committee process?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say no bills tend to do that.  \nWe passed bills just this past week probably in the -- the hundreds.  \nThe -- you know, I'd imagine -- \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Most of which came out a \ncommittee of jurisdiction .  Did this go through the Judiciary \nCommittee?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Ways and Means. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Yeah.  It didn't go through the \nJudiciary Committee.  Okay.  Thank you very much.\nMR. RIVERA:  You got it.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  On the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I am against this bill.  I think \nit, one, was done in a way where proper consultation with all the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n61parties involved was not handled.  It sort of popped out of the air here \nat the last minute at the end of Session.  But more importantly than \nthat, as I said yesterday in the debate regarding judicial certificates of \nauthorization --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walker, why \ndo you rise?  \nMS. WALKER:  Madam Speaker, I rise to see if the \nspeaker would yield for a couple of questions. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  No, I will not.  I will finish \nwhat I'm saying. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The speaker does \nnot yield, \nMS. WALKER:  Thank --\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So, it's -- it's popped out of the \nair at the last minute at the end of Session, and undermines faith in our \njudicial system.  The judicial system is a source of stability in a world, \na political world, with a lot of unstability [sic], a lot of partisanship \nand a lot of polarization.  This completely undermines that as a \nbulwark of stability within our system of government and, therefore, I \nwill be voting in the negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Ra.   \nMR. RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n62MR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. RA:  So, I have a number of questions, but I'm \ngonna start in a totally different area.  For -- many of my colleagues \nare probably aware of the fact that we base the New York State Board \nof Regents on judicial districts.  So have we done -- because \nobviously, as -- as it pertains to the judges, there are judges, their \nnames are in this bill as to where they're going to end up.  Have we \ndone a similar thing in looking at who the members of the Board of \nRegents are, when their terms are up, and how that would play out \nwith these changes?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No.  No.  The -- you know, the \nchanges wouldn't take into effect until '27, so, you know, it doesn't \naffect the current Board of Regents. \nMR. RA:  Well, but there would have to be Regents \nfor those new districts.  There could be Regents that are currently \nliving in one judicial district that are no longer in that judicial district.  \nAnd the terms might expire at a particular time, which is why it's \ntroubling when a bill like this gets dropped a couple of days before it's \npassed; which is why OCA is weighing in saying slow down.  There \nare implications to us passing this.  I don't care when it takes effect.  \nWe are addressing the justices and -- and where they're being \nallocated.  But -- so we haven't -- this hasn't been looked at at all, how \nthis would impact the current makeup of the Board of Regents and the \nmakeup of the Board of Regents in the future?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n63MR. RIVERA:  Whenever their terms will be up will \nbe up.  There was no consideration for Regents in this bill, no. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So what if a current member of the \nBoard of Regents is suddenly in a different judicial district?  Or what \nif -- I mean, what if two members of the Board of Regents -- and I \nassume by your answer that you haven't looked at this -- what if two \nmembers of the Board of Regents, you know, one is currently in one \njudicial district and has now moved into another judicial district?  \nThat district is only allowed to have one Regent.  What happens?  \nDoes one get kicked off the Board of Regents?  \n(Pause/Conferencing)\nMR. RIVERA:  As it stands right now, if any -- if any \nBoard of Regent [sic] that happens to be in one of these judicial \ndistricts where I'm -- I'm not even sure if that --  if there is any.  If \nthere are any, they would go through the same process that we would \ndo in any other sort of year.  Their terms are unaffected by this.  So \nthat's it. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  Well, thank you.  I -- I -- I think this \nis something that should have been thought about as this was being \nadvanced. \nSo going back to really the issue at hand as it pertains \nto the Judiciary.  You -- you stated to one of my colleagues earlier that \nyou disagreed with the information he had come up with with regard \nto cost.  Do you -- do you have a dollar figure that you feel this -- that \nwould be associated with this bill?  Obviously, we would have to look \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n64at that in future budgets.  This is going into effect in two years.  Do \nyou have a fiscal amount with regard to any new administrative staff, \nany new infrastructure?  Anything that would be involved in the \nimplementation of this bill. \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  It's our belief that, again, \nconsidering that we are not creating new judgeships that, you know, \nwe're simply placing them in different places.  We believe that the \ncost is absolutely nominal. \nMR. RA:  Well, it -- it doesn't seem like OCA agrees \nwith -- with that.  And -- and just as my colleague noted, I -- I will say \nthis -- because of the time in Session we are, it went through the Ways \nand Means Committee rather than the Judiciary.  So I wish we had a \nmore firm answer as to what that -- that number was.\nWith regard to the apportionment of these judges, so \nwe -- we spell out the names of each of these judges, correct, and what \njudicial district they would be serving in. \nMR. RIVERA:  That's required by the Constitution. \nMR. RA:  Now, am I correct that there are judges that \nwould now be serving judicial districts that they don't reside in?  \nMR. RIVERA:  In the scenarios where that's \nhappened we tried to minimize that as much as possible.  That is \nwhat's going to happen whenever a redistricting occurs.  There's not a \nresidential requirement to serve in the district, so it -- it's not the \ninconvenience of somebody literally moving where they live.  Again, I \n-- I -- the -- the burden is not, you know, excessive. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n65MR. RA:  Okay.  And have you looked at in terms of \nthese judges that are listed, how many of them are, you know, in the \nsituation that they may be hitting retirement, mandatory retirement age \nin the interim of this bill going into effect?  Do we know that number?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, as in how many are going to \nretire next year?  \nMR. RA:  Yeah.  As -- as we know, you -- you have \nto retire at 76.  So do we know if any of these judges who are spelled \nout are going to hit that retirement age before this bill goes into effect?  \nMR. RIVERA:  We don't. \nMR. RA:  Because, you know, the reason I'm asking \nis we've spelled out the names of them rather than, you know, it --  it's \n-- it's unique, I -- I would say, to the Judiciary, right?  If we were \ntalking about Assembly Districts, there's a district number and -- and \nwe'd be talking about the district itself.  I -- I ask that because that also \nis going to have an impact on future elections.  \nNow, it's spelled out in this bill that when people run \nas -- for justice spots on the Supreme Court in 2026, they'll be running \nin line with these new districts; is that correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. RA:  What about anybody who's up this fall? \nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, well if they're running this fall \nthey're already on the ballot. \nMR. RA:  No, they're not.\nMR. RIVERA:  Or they will be after the judicial \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n66convention is over.\nMR. RA:  The judicial convention is over the \nsummer. \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  So that doesn't -- it doesn't \nchange for this year. \nMR. RA:  But how -- so they would run under the \ncurrent judicial districts?  \nMR. RIVERA:  If I'm on the ballot today running for \nSupreme Court, I'm running under the current judicial district. \nMR. RA:  Well, again, you're not on -- nobody's -- \nMR. RIVERA:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMR. RA:  -- on the ballot.  It could be -- judicial \nconventions occur over the summer --\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct.\nMR. RA:  -- to designate those candidates. \nMR. RIVERA:  Right.\nMR. RA:  So what -- how are we going to apportion \nany judges -- any justices of the Supreme Court who are elected this \nfall if they're in one of these districts?  Do we -- are we gonna have to \ncome back and, by name, do, you know, essentially a chapter \namendment to figure out which district they would be serving in going \nforward?  Because they're gonna be elected to a 14-year term. \n(Pause/Conferencing)\nMR. RIVERA:  Whether we anticipate a chapter \namendment, we do not.  There's been conversations between the OCA \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n67and we don't anticipate that being a scenario that we have to be \nconcerned with. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  But if -- if somebody, say, is elected \nto become a Supreme Court justice in the 14th Judicial District this \nfall -- \nMR. RIVERA:  There is no 14th Judicial District. \nMR. RA:  I'm sorry?\nMR. RIVERA:  There is no 14th Judicial District \ncurrently.\nMR. RA:  Well, I'm sorry.  The -- one of -- in the -- \nokay, so let's say --\nMR. RIVERA:  Let's say the 8th.\nMR. RA:  -- the 7th Judicial District. \nMR. RIVERA:  Okay. \nMR. RA:  Okay?  How are they going to be allocated \ncome January -- does it go into effect January 2027 or sometime later \nin 2027?  \nMR. RIVERA:  January 2027. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So how are they going to be \nassigned in terms of which district they will serve come January of \n2027?  Because their name's not in this bill because they haven't been \nnominated yet, how are they going to be assigned which district they'll \nbe serving in after they've gotten elected this fall to represent the 7th \nJudicial District?  \nMR. RIVERA:  This deals -- this bill deals with the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n68judges who are judges today.  There is no way to capture what could \nbe a hypothetical election of a hypothetical candidate.  So I guess -- \nthis speaks to the judges who are judges today. \nMR. RA:  It may be hypothetical, but I -- I mean, I \ndon't know about everyplace else in the State.  We have Supreme \nCourt justices on the ballot every -- every year.  So I don't think it's \nhypothetical.  We don't know the individual's name, but I could pretty \nclose to guarantee you that there's somebody that's going to be running \nin one of these districts this fall that's name is not in this bill and is not \ngonna -- there's gonna be some, I don't know, legal ambiguity as to \nwhere they're going to be serving come January of 2027. \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I mean -- yeah, I mean the \nseat is -- you know, we -- we list the names of the judges that are \ncurrently there.  The seats that those judges currently occupy are no \ndifferent from the seats that are gonna be up for election this year.  So \nthe election will be held, OCA would -- would -- would determine it.  \nThey would stay within, you know, the -- they'd certainly stay within \ntheir department, and then OCA would assist in allocating them where \nto be. \nMR. RA:  So the -- so OCA will determine which \ndistrict they're assigned to going forward?  Is that what you're saying?  \nMR. RIVERA:  OCA, in any scenario, determines \nwhere they sit. \nMR. RA:  Well, where they sit, but --  \nMR. RIVERA:  That would be no different. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n69MR. RA:  Yes, but we have statutory numbers of \njudges in each of these departments.  So presumably, somebody has to \nbe able to determine that this person -- yes, you can sit in a different \ndistrict, as -- as we know.  I mean, I could -- I could be on the ballot \nthis fall -- I'm not going to be, obviously -- but I could be on the ballot \nthis fall in Erie County for a justice. \nMR. RIVERA:  Come on down. \nMR. RA:  Nah, I like Long Island. \nMR. RIVERA:  I figured. \nMR. RA:  But, so you could sit in a different district, \nbut in terms of where they are actually allocated for purposes of that \nstatutory number we have of districts in each -- there -- there seems to \nbe a great deal of ambiguity here as to how we're going to deal with \nthat if somebody's elected in the interim of -- of after we've passed this \nbill.  And I -- I don't -- I don't see how there's any other solution other \nthan us anticipating doing some future amendment to this to name \nthose judges and where they're going. \nMR. RIVERA:  I don't perceive it to be ambiguous.  I \nthink that OCA creates the rules and makes the decisions \nadministratively to determine these things. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So -- so you are saying that OCA is \ngoing to make that determination then. \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, there's already a designation of \nhow many judicial district slots or judgeships there are in each one of \nthese districts.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n70MR. RA:  Yes.\nMR. RIVERA:  If one district is down one, we know \nwhere that person would be placed. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So OCA will have the ability to \nmake that determination administratively as to what judicial district \nthat individual is -- is serving?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I perceive that as no different from \nthe abil -- the -- sort of their capacity and what they can do today. \nMR. RA:  Well, I -- I wouldn't agree with that \nbecause they could -- they can allocate judges different places.  They \ncan't change which judicial district they've been elected in. \nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. RA:  Those are two different things. \nLastly, I -- I know you said, you know, that you did \nnot look at caseload, but my understanding is that in 2024 there were \n7,000 new cases filed in Erie and 2,900 filed in the other seven \ncounties of the 8th Judicial District.  So if you divide that by 13 \njudges, that's about 22 -- 220 new cases per year.  Now, if we're \ndividing the districts now, I mean, are we basically gonna have to \nhave a lot of these judges still be assigned to work in Erie anyway to \nbe able to keep up with that caseload?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, I'd say that -- that's why the -- \nthe new 8th Judicial District has 18, and the -- sort of the newly- \ncreated one around it will have ten.  You know, it -- the population of \nthese municipal -- of the counties are taken into account on the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n71portions of what judges go where.  You know, caseloads are gonna \ncome and go.  They're gonna be up and down, and we're making the \nbest decisions we can with the information we have before us. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  I -- thank you, Mr. Rivera.\nMadam Speaker, very briefly on the bill.  I still have \n15 seconds. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. RA:  I'll come back and explain my vote.  But \nthere are far too many questions here that don't have answers.  That's \nwhy bills that are this complex should not be dropped the last week of \nSession when there are so many different entities that need to weigh in \nto make sure something like this is done effectively.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Reilly. \nMR. REILLY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, sir.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  The sponsor yields.\nMR. REILLY:  So, Mr. Rivera, just -- what I heard \nearlier was that the intent of this bill is for the Judiciary to be \nreflective of the community that it's represented by; is that correct?\nMR. RIVERA:  In 2007 when we made sure that the \ngood people of Staten Island were gonna have their own district, we \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n72did so, I believe, granted it predates me, that we were doing so \nbelieving that, you know, the folks who live there and wanted to be \nrepresented more fairly and I think that this is exactly the same thing \nwe're doing now. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  Does this bill add a judicial \nseat to Richmond County?\nMR. RIVERA:  No, but if you want now -- no.\nMR. REILLY:  We're gonna get into that. \nMR. RIVERA:  I'm sure.\nMR. REILLY:  Thank you. \nOn the bill, Madam Speaker.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.  \nMR. REILLY:  So, I heard so many things here about \ndiversity, equity, inclusion.  Not only in this bill, but, of course, over \nthe several days that we've been here.  One of the things that the \nsponsor mentioned, which I reiterated, right, reflective judiciary of the \ncommunity.  When we debated a bill about judges that were being \nappointed, or seats being created, we were told, don't worry about \nRichmond  County.  They can get elected in Manhattan  and they can \nbe sent to Richmond  County.  The exact argument that I used of \nsaying, we need a judicial representation that's put in place by the \ncommunity they are going to hear cases in.  I was told, there's nothing \nto worry about with that .  On this legislation, it's the exact opposite.  \nThe hypocrisy is just outstanding.  And when I -- the reason why I \nbrought up diversity, equity, inclusion, we hear diversity, we hear \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n73equity, but we always leave out that \"I\"; inclusion, inclusiveness.  \nThat means hearing from all sides.  We don't ever hear that part.  \nBeing inclusive sometimes is allowing people with different opinions \nto have input.  We see often in bills that we put in about forming \ncommissions, oh, there's no Minority member appointments .  I get it.  \nI get it.  You control the House, the other House and the Executive.  \nThat's how it works.  I get it.  But if you truly want to have DEI and be \ninclusive, then we would hear from all stakeholders.  But, the \nhypocrisy of this bill coming to the floor right after we had budget \nseason and the same exact arguments that I'm bringing up today, I was \ntold, don't worry about.  You can get elected in Manhattan .  You can \nget elected in Queens.  You can get elected in the Bronx.  They can \nassign someone to Richmond  County.  Why does it fall on deaf ears?  \nThere's only one reason.  It's about politics and we know that.  \nNow, ironically in this bill, it's one of the seats there, \none of the judicial seats here, would hear election appeals.  That was a \nbill that we did last year I believe, right?  And we made it where only \nfour counties can hear and appeal on an Election Law in regards to \nelections.  Isn't it ironic that now we're changing those seats so that \nmaybe the scale of justice may tilt a little to the left?  Justice, when \nyou look at it, right, it wears a blindfold, right?  She's always wearing \na blindfold.  Obviously, it does not wear -- she does not wear a \nblindfold, because we all know that this has nothing more to do than \nbeing a Democrat or a Republican.  And I get it, you're in charge, \nthat's how it's done.  We can do better and we must do better. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n74Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Bologna. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield for a few questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, sir.  So, Mr. Rivera, \nbeing from the same county, same next of the woods -- \nMR. RIVERA:  Yup.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  -- familiar backgrounds, would it \nbe fair to say that when it comes to political operations; petitions, opt \nof ballot, the mechanics of ballot access, what -- whatever -- it doesn't \nmatter.  The office; whether it's a town judge, town board member, \ncounty, State Assembly, whatever it is, that there's a small group of -- \nof insiders, generally referred to as polls or politicos, that generally \nunderstand the mechanics of how ballot access and how this stuff \nworks.  Would you -- is that a fair assessment?  \nMR. RIVERA:  If you're saying that the majority of \nthe people that are involved in politics is a small subset of people from \nour region, I suppose that's partially true.  Sure, I suppose.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  And then -- \nMR. RIVERA:  But I'd also say that it's incumbent \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n75upon us that are elected, you know, we represent districts of 130,000 \npeople, impossible to meet them all.  So, we know that at the end of \nthe day we're just trying to, you know, be as fair as we can to as many \npeople as possible, being honored by their vote.  And at the end of the \nday, I think one universal thing that people have communicated to me \non both sides of the aisle, as you know, I represent a district that is, \nyou know, certainly not as blue as others, I -- I -- I would say the one \nuniversal truth is, people want to know that -- that the people that \nthey're engaging with in government, is represent -- are they a \nrepresentative of who they are?  And I do look at the other counties in \nthe current judicial district and I know that's it not reflective.  I know \nthat if I am from Wyoming, or Genesee County, Orleans County, the \nprobability of being elected to the State Supreme Court is minimal, \nregardless of your political affiliation, because Erie County just \noccupies so much seats in that judicial district.  So, I think, at the end \nof the day, whether there are many people involved in politics, very \nfew people involved in politics, people that are brand new, or people \nthat have been here forever, at the end of the day, you know, the -- the \neagerness to be reassured a fair representation supercedes all -- all of \nit. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you for that.  I mean -- but \nas far as the mechanics are concerned, I mean, it's -- it is a small -- this \nis a very inside baseball build in -- and within that political structure, \nthere's even a smaller subset of -- of people who are of the legal \npolitical, you know, judicial, you know, ilk of that.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n76MR. RIVERA:  Yeah -- \nMR. BOLOGNA:  So, my -- my question for you is, \nwhy are we -- why are we doing this?  Like, who is -- who is \ncalling with -- what public outcry is happening here?  Who is calling \nfor this?  \nMR. RIVERA:  If we waited for public outcry for \nevery bill we did, we wouldn't do many bills here.  So, that's why.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So, why are we doing this?  \nMR. RIVERA:  We're doing this because these lines, \nI said to Mr. Jensen earlier, I can say it easily to you too, these lines \nhaven't been changed since both of our, you know, times on this \nplanet multiplied by two.  There is no reason that we should wait \nanother minute to look at the lines that determine who our judges in \nthis State, that have been still, stagnant, there, the same way for \ndecades and look at it and say, well, what's the outcry?  Well , what -- \nwhat difference does it make?   There is a problem.  The fact that we \nhave not done this faster and sooner is the problem.  \nSo, you're right.  There is no public outcry, but for the \nsame reason you mentioned before.  It's because the average person \nwho lives in New York State, especially if you're just living paycheck \nto paycheck, they are not concerned, or aware, of judicial conventions \nand when that happens and all of that in between.  All they know is if \nthey are confronted with the justice system, they want -- they want to \nknow that they are treated fairly and justly and ideally by someone \nthat knows their community and that's what this does. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n77MR. BOLOGNA:  I can -- I can appreciate that.  I \nreally can.  So, I guess, another question and based on that would be, \nwhy, given the current makeup and -- and, I guess, I'll speak \nspecifically to the 8th Judicial of which you and I currently live in.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yup. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Why is it, you know, that \nthe process -- what -- how -- how do I say this?  Why is it that it is the \nway it is?  Why is that there is this lack of representation, whether it's \ndiversity based on, you know, location?  Why -- why is it that that is \nhappening?  Based on the -- the -- I mean, I know that judicial \nconventions happen.  Don't -- don't committee and judicial delegates \nwork through the Chair?  So, isn't this kind of a problem of -- of the -- \nof the Chairman, longstanding tradition of both parties and not \nnominating more -- a more diverse group of people?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I would say, going back to your point \nearlier about -- about, sort of, some folks not knowing processes.  The \ntruth of the matter is, there are -- the -- the way that we elect judges \nand vote for judges, you know, the conventions, none of that, number \none, has changed in this bill.  So, the processes by which we elect \njudges is unchanged.  So, we'll put that aside.  But the fact that this \nwas sort of a longstanding thing is not reason to continue to perpetuate \nit.  The fact that it has been a longstanding, sort of, way that the \njudicial districts are configured is all the reason to change it.  We're \nnot changing processes.  People will still get elected the way they got \nelected.  There is, you know, the -- the mechanics of it all, as you put \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n78it, is -- is unchanged.  What is changed is the -- the simple boundaries \nof what -- where those districts are. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  So, how does this fix -- how does \nthis fix that?  What -- what is so special about Erie County?  What is it \nabout Erie County specifically, that giving it its own judicial district \nthat will now change that lack of diversity of representation?  What is \nit specifically about Erie County?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, as I said before, if you look at \nthe population of the 8th Judicial District, currently, as it stands, it's \nabout 1.5 million people.  Of that, 61 percent of it live in Erie County.  \nSo, it's a bit unfair for the other six counties that are currently in the \njudicial -- there are seven counties that are -- in the judicial district, to \nconstantly be at the whim of Erie County.  A county that is like a \n900,000 plus person county when these other counties are \nsubstantially smaller.  So just as much -- \nMR. BOLOGNA:  So you're doing this for the benefit \nof Niagara and Orleans and all those counties?  That's -- that's -- \nbecause you want to make sure that they're not at the will of Erie \nCounty?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I genuinely believe that now, \nif I am resident, a voter in Wyoming County, that I have a higher \nlikelihood today under the new maps of elect -- of electing a judge \nfrom my town -- from my county. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So, then I -- I guess, based \non that, then and, again, specifically -- because I know you -- you gave \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n79some numbers earlier with, you know, the populations and -- and the \nmetrics within Niagara -- or Erie County.  So, like, is the objective of \nthis bill, then, to create a judicial district based on representation of \nrace and ethical -- and ethnic background?  \nMR. RIVERA:  No.  I'm -- my -- the interest of this \nbill -- \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Is it a factor?  \nMR. RIVERA:  -- is to make it so the judicial \ndistricts can more easily reflect the -- the -- the -- what makes them \nwhat they are.  For example, like I said before, Erie -- Erie County is \nan almost million person county.  It should be in its own judicial \ndistrict in part because of the population, but in part because the -- the \nnature of that county and the makeup of that population is so \ndrastically more diverse than any other county in that judicial district, \nthat it puts both sets of those -- of that argument, whether it's just Erie \nCounty, or the remaining counties in the judicial district, at -- at -- at \nan impasse of having to, you know -- if I am from -- I'll use \nCattaraugus, for example, Cattaraugus, which, I think -- I don't think \nhas any judges to Supreme right now, although I might be wrong, in \nour judicial district, gives them a fighting chance to elect somebody \nfrom their county.  And in Eric County, it allows us to -- to commit to \nthe goal that OCA itself acknowledges that we have not had sufficient \ndiversity in our justice system. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So, it -- diversity then, in \nthat -- in that context, is a factor.  Racial, ethnic diversity is a -- is a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n80factor in this legislation.\nMR. RIVERA:  I'd say it's a factor in every aspect of \nthe justice system.  So -- \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  \nMR. RIVERA:  -- yes.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So, back to the -- the 8th, \nI -- off the top of my head, I forget what Erie -- the new Erie County \nDistrict is going to be, but this -- let's just focus on that for a second.\nMR. RIVERA:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  So, we're essentially creating a \nState Supreme Court judicial district for the County of Erie by itself?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Correct.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  And with the goal of \nhopeful -- hopefully making that more diverse.  There are countywide \njudges, currently, in that.  Now, not for State Supreme Court, but for \ncounty offices, correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Every county has county court \njudges, yes.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So, what we have, Erie \nCounty Family Court, right, that are basically be running in the same \ndistrict, correct?  \nMR. RIVERA:  The county lines are the county lines, \nwhether you're running for county executive, comptroller, county \njudge.  Yes.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  So -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n81MR. RIVERA:  A county's a county. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Out of the current Erie County \nFamily Court judges -- I'm just trying to think of the makeup.  Is \nthere -- are there any -- off the top of your head, do you know of any \nethnically or racially diverse members of that Body?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Of what Body?  I'm sorry.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Eric County Family Court.\nMR. RIVERA:  Honestly, I couldn't tell you.  This \nbill is about Supreme Court.  I -- \n(Crosstalk)\nMR. BOLOGNA:  I'm gonna get to that --\nMR. RIVERA:  (Indiscernible/crosstalk)\nMR. BOLOGNA:  So, we have -- we have one.  And \nthen Erie County Court itself, are you aware of anybody who's \nethically, racially diverse on that court?  \nMR. RIVERA:  On which court?  Sorry. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Erie County Court.\nMR. RIVERA:  Again, this is about -- \nMR. BOLOGNA:  All right.  Zero -- \nMR. RIVERA:  -- the judicial districts.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  It's zero.  So, it would seem to me \nthat -- \nMR. RIVERA:  So, you're -- you're essentially \nsupporting my point that the -- \nMR. BOLOGNA:  No.  I -- I -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n82MR. RIVERA:  -- court should be more diverse.\nMR. BOLOGNA:  -- I think the issue is more with \nyour county chairman and less with the judicial lines, in terms of \ncandidate recruitment.  That is what I think the biggest issue here is.  \nAnd if it -- actually, Madam -- thank -- Mr. Rivera, thank you very \nmuch.  \nMadam Speaker, can we go on the bill?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  I -- I think that this is a -- a -- an \nattempt to consolidate judicial power in political parties.  I -- I'm -- \nreally, it's a -- we've done two bills now in two days that have really, \nfrankly, dis -- disheartened me towards our judicial system.  \nI've always been taught from the time I was in grade \nschool that -- that justices are -- are made to be impartial.  And I don't \nreally see a way that, you know, this helps that, because this is hyper \npoliticizing everything that we're doing within this system.  So, I -- I -- \nI'm -- I'm actually sorely disappointed.  I think that one of my \ncolleagues used the word \"hyp -- hypocrisy\".  I think there is a -- a fair \namount of hypocrisy within -- trying to preserve our -- our judicial \nsystem and preserve what we think is good about that.  And what is \nimpartial about that, neutral is the way it should be.  But yet, we've \nspent now 48 hours politicizing the New York State judiciary system.  \nSo, I'm very disappointed in that regard.\nAnd, Madam Speaker, I'll be voting down on this \npiece of legislation. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n83ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Durso. \nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Would \nthe sponsor yield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, sir.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Mr. Rivera.  So, I am \nprobably one of the least knowledgeable people about this topic.  So, \nthis should be pretty easy.  My questions will be somewhat basic.  \nWhen will this law take effect if signed by the Governor and passes \ntoday?  \nMR. RIVERA:  The -- the actual judicial districts \ntake effect in '27, January 1st, '27.  The judges that run for office in '26 \nwill be ruining on the new lines.\nMR. DURSO:  I'm sorry.  Say that last part again, sir.\nMR. RIVERA:  The -- the -- the folks that are \nrunning for office, to assume office January 1st, they run in '26.  \nThe -- the new offices will be '27. \nMR. DURSO:  So, the people that are already \nelected, that are already sitting in those judicial seats will then also \nmove in '27, correct?  If they are the ones chosen to move?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nMR. DURSO:  Oh.  Bless you, sir.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n84MR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nMR. DURSO:  So, how -- do we know how many \njudges that are currently seated, will have to be moved once this takes \nplace in '27?\nMR. RIVERA:  Well, I suppose it's -- it's laid out in \nthe bill what judges go to what districts, but I would say -- when you \nsay moved, you mean like physically relocate?  \nMR. DURSO:  Yes.  Yeah.  Will -- will be running or \n-- excuse me, be put into a judicial district they weren't elected to.  \nMR. RIVERA:  Well, just remember, this -- this \ndoesn't truncate their terms.  So, if anybody is a sitting judge currently \nand they were just elected last year, they still have 13 years under, you \nknow, without having to run again is what I'm saying.  \nMR. DURSO:  Right.  I -- I understand it doesn't \nchange the -- the length of time that they're running.  I'm saying, if \nthey ran in district -- this district here, they could be moved to another \ndistrict, right, to -- to fill those vacancies that you need.\nMR. RIVERA:  Well, remember these folks are \nassigned by OCA to the county that they're assigned to.  That doesn't \nchange in this.  So --  \nMR. DURSO:  So, who -- who votes for these judges \nthen?\nMR. RIVERA:  Like who el -- who elects them?  \nMR. DURSO:  Yes.\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh.  Well, the process is unchanged,  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n85you know, the -- the whatever -- a party circulates petitions in the \nsame timeline as when our petitions are circulated for judicial \ndelegates and then a convention is held in usually August.  August.  \nAnd then, the -- the delegates of their respective parties, choose their \nrespective candidates.  \nMR. DURSO:  Well, I -- I understand that part of it.  \nI'm -- I'm saying the residents that live in the area, correct, vote for \nthese judges, correct? \nMR. RIVERA:  Sure. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So now, they're voting for a \njudge that's running on the line that represents their area, essentially, \nat the time for that district that it was presently constituted.  Not \nstarting next year, currently, correct?  So, in other words, I voted for a \njudge that's on the ballot that I go and vote, you know, if it's my \nelection, your election, if someone's on the ballot that year, people are \ngoing out and voting for these judges, correct?  Just like you, or me?\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  Now, it's possible that a judge \nwas elected, right, by people that will no longer be able to vote for \nthat judge, per se, if they were able to run again, not represented.  In \nother words, I voted for you to be, you know, on the ballot as -- as the \njudge I'm voting for, they can now be put into a district where I \ncould've no longer voted for you to be that judge, correct?\nMR. RIVERA:  Well, that could happen today, I \nguess is what I would say.  That -- that could hypothetically happen \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n86today.  But, for example, in the -- in -- in my district, where I live, \nwe'll use that as an example --\nMR. DURSO:  Sure.\nMR. RIVERA:  -- in a -- if -- if I voted for a judge in \nCattaraugus County -- \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.\nMR. RIVERA: -- I'm just picking a county, currently \nin the 8th Judicial District, it's in the 15th District as well.  So, there's \nno change.  In the majority of counties, there is no change. \nMR. DURSO:  But there will be a change in some.  \nThere -- there -- there's a possibility that it could, correct?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  But, again, where a judge is \nseated is depended upon what OCA designates -- where -- wherever \nthey tell them to sit.\nMR. DURSO:  Do we -- do we have an idea of how \nmany of those judges may be moved out of a district they weren't \nelected in?\nMR. RIVERA:  Well, it's reflected in the -- in the bill \nwhere it lists the judges.  So, it says, if you're, you know -- it -- it lists \njudges in Judicial District 8.  I'll use as an example, the new Judicial \nDistrict 15, it lists the ones that are there.  It's there.   \nMR. DURSO:  Right.  So, if I voted in 8, but now \nthat judge is moved to 15, right, if that election would have taken \nplace today, I might not have been able to vote for a judge that I voted \nfor last year, this year.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n87MR. RIVERA:  That's true, but you're \n(indiscernible/cross-talk) -- somebody that has a 14 year term, so, it's \nunlikely.\nMR. DURSO:  Well -- well --\nMR. RIVERA:  Just -- I mean, yes, you -- you might \nbe able to say, well, I can't vote for this person who I voted for 14 \nyears ago. \nMR. DURSO:  Correct, but -- but -- but when you go \nin to elect these judges, it does say on the ballot, ten year term, 14 year \nterm, correct?\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.\nMR. DURSO:  But, now, your -- so, someone I may \nhave voted for for a 14 year term, I no longer have as a judge in my \ndistrict, correct?  Even though I voted for them, they could essentially \nbe taken away from me as the voter?\nMR. RIVERA:  But, you know, this bill doesn't \nchange that because you could vote for them today hypothetically --\nMR. DURSO:  Right.\nMR. RIVERA: -- and they now -- they might not be \nin your district.  Not be seated, I should say, where you are. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  But, I can still vote for them?  \nSo, what if -- if they're -- and I understand they're not seated where I \nam, right, but the overall vote -- I still have to vote for them, correct?\nMR. RIVERA:  Once every 14 years. \nMR. DURSO:  Correct.  What I'm saying is, they \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n88were elected into that position by the voters that they -- I don't want to \nsay \"be represented by\", you know, those voters aren't represented by \na judge, but they are voted on by the voters in that district.  Which \nnow they will no longer be the judge in some of those districts any \nlonger, correct? \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  But, what you're not taking \ninto account is the -- the probability of that narrows because, again, in \nthe case of my county, it, you know, the only change in my judicial \ndistrict is one county.  So, if you lived in any other county, you are \ngetting the same district, the same judge.  Judges. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  I'm -- I'm not taking into \naccount the probability, but what you are saying, it is going to happen \nin certain districts? \nMR. RIVERA:  It is going to happen in certain \ndistricts, yes. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So, and -- and that just brings \nme to my larger point, is that we are now, essentially, disenfranchising \nvoters, because they voted for someone that no longer is going to be in \ntheir district.  So, we vote -- we -- we had voters last year that could \nhave went in and voted for someone for a 14 year term and now we're \ntelling them, sorry, they no longer are in that district.   How is that fair \nto the voters who voted for them?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  The -- that only matters for \npurposes of reelection.\nMR. DURSO:  Well, no, but it doesn't.  So, what -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n89what I'm saying to you is, you're -- you're saying that you want more \npeople in those districts to be representative of the people that are in \nthat district, correct?  Which, I understand.  But, at the time, they were \nvoted on for a ten or 14 year term and we're now telling the people in \nthat area, the person that you voted for, whether they voted for them, \nor against them, is no longer going to be your representative and we're \nmaking that decision here.  We're not letting the voters decide, we're \njust saying, sorry, you could no longer have this judge.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I -- I guess the only thing I \nwould say is, I mean, we can kind of go in circles on it, but, at the -- at \nthe end of the day, OCA can make that decision with or without this.\nMR. DURSO:  But -- but -- right, I -- and I \nunderstand exactly what you're saying.  But -- \nMR. RIVERA:  That's the higher probability -- \nactually, the two higher probabilities is that these judges are not going \nto run for reelection.  So, they would retire at some point, either \nbecause of their age, or for whatever reason, or that OCA could \npotentially just move a judge to a different place.  That's substantially \nmore likely than the scenario, I think that -- that -- that you're -- \nMR. DURSO:  But, what my concern is, it is -- it's \npossible.  So, again, you brought up redistricting before with us, right?  \nIt -- it does happen every ten years, but every time there's redistricting, \nwe have public hearings and you can't be redistricted out in the middle \nof your elected term, but we're doing that to judges.  Isn't that \ndisenfranchising voters?  Again, whether you agree with who's in that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n90position, why they're in that position, who voted for them, the fact of \nthe matter is, they were voted for and we're saying, that person will no \nlonger represent you.\nMR. RIVERA:  I -- I guess that what I would say to \nthat at the end is that the State Constitution is clear.  We're able to do \nthis every ten years, despite their terms being even larger than that.  \nSo, this is an inevitable thing that -- that would happen no matter the \nscenario, no matter the timing, that as long as we're able to do this \nevery ten years, if we choose to -- since we're authorized to and their \nterms are greater than ten years, then that is something that's taken \ninto account and considered. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So -- \nMR. RIVERA:  And everyone obviously finishes \ntheir current term.  So, it's not as if a -- a voter can look at a judge and \nthat judge look at them and say, sorry, because of a bill that they \npassed in Albany, I no longer am a -- am your judge.  I \ndisenfranchised  -- you know, the State doesn't disenfranchise \nsomebody by saying, judge, you can't be a judge anymore.   That \nwould be the problem.\nMR. DURSO:  No.\nMR. RIVERA:  These judges are able to fill their -- \ntheir terms and they're still, as they are today under this new bill, they \nare, you know, constraint to how OCA determines how judges are \nplaced, seated.\nMR. DURSO:  I completely understand, but as much \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n91as a judge can't sit there and say to the voters, sorry, I no longer \nrepresent you, we shouldn't be able to sit there and say, sorry, you ran \nfor office, we're just going to move you.  That being said, I have a \nquestion:  Could a current elected Supreme Court judge that's unhappy \nwith where they were moved to, or they're assigned to, under this \nlegislation, run for a Supreme Court seat from the original JD that \nthey're assigned -- instead of being assigned to another?\nMR. RIVERA:  Nothing prevents a judge from \nseeking a -- a -- an election anywhere they want to run. \nMR. DURSO:  Can they --\nMR. RIVERA:  There's no residency required -- \nMR. DURSO:  And I'm -- I'm asking that because \nthere's no residency requirement.\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct.\nMR. DURSO:  So, if they're elected to a 14 year term \nlast year, they get moved to a different JD, they could run next year \nfor Supreme Court judge again, do they still get a 14 year term?  Do \nthey have to run -- can they run in another district?\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, I mean, there -- there's nothing \npreventing a judge today from running for a different judicial office in \na different region.  I would only say, it would be a strange thing to do \nbecause at the end of the day, OCA can just put them back to where \nthey were in the beginning, but -- \nMR. DURSO:  Right, but you -- \nMR. RIVERA:  -- I suppose.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n92MR. DURSO:  And again, like I said, I'm not fully \nknowledgeable of this, it's just more of a question.  So, while they're a \nsitting judge, let's say on their tenth year out of 14, can they -- they \ncan run for a different JD before their term is up? \n(Conferencing)\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah, I mean, there's not a limitation \non what a judge can do as -- as a candidate running for office, but I \nthink at the end of the day, we've spent a lot of time talking about the \n-- the -- the -- the what perceived to be inconvenience of a judges \nmoving a county over, which in many cases, is a pretty short commute \nfrankly.  When, at the end of the day, what we really should be talking \nabout is the representation, how judges are -- are elected, the -- the \nability for people to be able to seen by people from their community, I \nthink that just is more important than sort of the -- the emphasis on \nwhat could be a very slight inconvenience for judges. \nMR. DURSO:  Oh, I'm not looking at the -- the \ninconvenience for judges, believe me.  I'm more looking at it as -- it \ndoesn't matter to me, I'm being perfectly honest.  Judges, lawyers, it's \nfine.  My concern is the people that voted for them and put them in \nthose positions.\nMR. RIVERA:  I -- I guess my response to that is, my \nbigger concern is not the folks that had voted for whatever candidate \nis in front of them, is the -- is the fact that the voters that vote are -- \nare so, more often than not, given the opportunity to vote for \nsomebody from their community, because of the way that the lines are \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n93-- are -- are set to begin with.  So, the disadvantage isn't whether I \nvoted for a -- for a person and now they're going to be in the county \nover, the disadvantage is, I am -- you know, what history has already \nshown us, it is im -- not impossible, but highly, highly, highly \nimprobable and historically, has never happened in some of these \nregions, that -- that -- that someone from a community is actually \nseated as a judge.  And that's because we have this sort of \ndisproportionate thing going on where we have a -- a -- a sort of, three \npopulation centers that overpower judicial districts and it prevents \ncertain people from being elected from certain places, when this looks \nto cure that by allowing people a -- a clearer path, frankly, to -- to -- to \nrunning for judge if you live in -- in one of these non, sort of, massive \ncounties.  And that's really the -- the -- the bigger, you know, sort of \nthe bigger point of it all.  \nMR. DURSO:  I understand what you're saying.  So, \nand -- and I'm trying to put it into words exactly what I feel like you \nmeant.  Which is, you want representatives from your area, being the \nrepresentative that you want, correct?  Not -- from that -- from the \narea, just like anything else.  Just like you representing your district, \nyou're going to vote for someone from your district.  You want people \nthat live in your district, right, represent -- you have the same values \nas you do, to be your representative.  Correct?  I mean --\nMR. RIVERA:  Right.  And currently, the way that \nthe current lines are drawn, we're looking at possibly a dozen, if not \nmore, counties and telling them, you're so small compared to the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n94county next to you that is so big, the likelihood that you will get a \njudge from your county is almost impossible.  This looks to cure that \nproblem. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So, and -- and Mr. Rivera, I -- \nI appreciate you answering the questions.  My -- my only concern and \nonly real thought on this, again, is the election process and in my \nopinion, circumventing it.  And my last question for you is, do you \nhave that concern when we're doing that here?  Just as your concern is \nwith the judges from the areas, right?  As you want people to be \nrepresentative of the areas that they're in, we want people that we \nrepresent to have confidence.  Confidence in the judicial system, \nconfidence in elections, confidence in this Body.  Are you concerned, \nat all, that by changing the will of the voter, that have already voted \nfor these judges, that we are, again, disenfranchising voters and taking \naway their right for who they've already elected?\nMR. RIVERA:  Honestly, I -- I would say my greater \nconcern is the fact that anybody, whether you're a super informed, you \nknow, member of society or not, if you were to be told that the -- \nwhere you live is within a judicial district that hasn't been reviewed, \nchanged, amended -- \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Walker.\nMR. RIVERA:  -- in possibly decades, that's a bigger \nproblem.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walker.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n95MS. WALKER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOn the bill, please.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMS. WALKER:  So, you know, sometimes when you \ngo to church and you hear the Pastor, Bishop, speaking and you're \nlike, they must be talking to me.   This is exactly what I was hearing as \nI listened to the banter, the debate, over the sponsor of this bill \nintroducing a bill that talks about judicial representative \nrepresentation.  Then, I was like, is this a referendum on DEI?  Then \nit made me look at myself to say, is this DEI conversation about me?   \nAnd I said, yes, of course , because I DEI definitely earned it.   The \nability to be able to stand here and listen to the hypocrisy that I've \nheard in this moment.  It also made me go back to a poem that I heard \nin talking about redistricting.  It was something that was given out by \na Klansman regarding a U.S. election poll and it reads; when cotton \ngrows on the fig tree and alfalfa hangs on the rose.  When the aliens \nrun the United States and the Jews grow a straight nose.  When the \nPope is praised by everyone in the land of Uncle Sam and a Greek is \nelected president, then the Ku Klux Klan won't be a damn .  Well, one \nof the seminal pieces of legislation in this country is the Civil Rights \nAct of 1965 and its progeny.  We know that its core is to prohibit \nracial discrimination and then going into the Voting Rights Act which \nprotects under the 15th Amendment, the right to vote which shall not \nbe denied by any race.  And as the circumstances was going around \nwith respect to how we got to the Civil Rights Act and the Voting \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n96Rights Act, there was an amajing -- amazing Archbishop -- \nArchbishop who was from the Central Council of the Archdiocese \nwho passed a resolution on racial equality.  It was signed by \nArchbishop Iakovos which condemned segregation and racial bigotry.  \nHe issued a statement that persecution, prejudice and intolerance is \nthe greatest sin that the -- of the free soul of the man can bear.  We \nknow race is a social construct, but we kept hearing it today.  We \nknow at one point when it came to race, it was only a WASP \ngeneration.  Those who were White, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant.  \nYes, we also heard about Lady Justice.  Lady Justice reads \"qui pro \ndomina justitia sequitu\" - protecting liberty and justice for all.  But \nguess what, just as we've seen under the Civil Rights Act, just as we've \nseen in that case that we talked about about that U.S. election poll and \nthe Klu Klux Klan, while we know that justice for all is supposed to \nbe for all, sometimes you gotta go to the Legislature to get the all to \ninclude you.  Sometimes you have to go to court to get the all to \ninclude you.  And then we're talking about court systems and having -- \nand being able to elect somebody who shares your values.  I \nremember there being this case.  It was a case of a young man who \nwas accused of robbery, and one of the determining factors on this \ncase was whether or not this young man actually went to the Chinese \nrestaurant in his community in order to purchase two chicken wings \nand french fries.  The jury in this situation could not understand \nbecause, in their community they can get dim sum, but they certainly \nwere not ordering chicken wings and french fries at the Chinese \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n97restaurant.  But for the judge who sat on that bench who had the lived \nexperiences in order to be able to identify and speak to the jury in \nprivate to be able to say, yes, look, this is the Chinese restaurant menu \nfrom my community and a person is able to get those things , so we \nabsolutely need a representative representation.   The spirit of this \nlegislation is to undo existing laws and procedures that have denied \nequal political opportunities for voters in those counties to be able to \nelect candidates of their choice.  Over time, there had been schemes to \ndilute protective classes and their access to voting.  And protective \nclasses was not created here.  A protective class is a group of people \nwho are legally shielded from discrimination, or harassment, based on \na shared characteristic.  Yes, such as race, religion, gender, disability \nand age.  So again, this is about access to justice, this is not a new \nphenomenon and we know how important it is for redistricting to be \nable to speak to apportionment, because our Census has told us that \nnumbers are growing, people are moving and demographics are \nchanging.  And so, in that regard, I encourage everyone to support this \npiece of legislation to allow for the voters in those particular counties \nto be able to seek and get access to real justice with a shared level of \nvalues, lived experiences, circumstances and by gosh, yes, including \nthose who share characteristics of them such as; race, religion, gender, \ndisability and/or age because those are protected classes.  It may have \ntaken us a generation to be able to get those classes to be protected, \nbut it will take a lifetime for us to protect it and in the matter of \nstanding up for democracy, as we are watching a Department of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n98Justice who is eroding its very nature.\nI support this legislation and I encourage our \ncolleagues to do the same day in honor, yes, of fairness, justice and \nequality.  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for allowing me to support this \nbill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Bailey.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield for a couple questions?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you very much, Mr. Rivera.  \nAnd I do apologize, you may have said it --\nMR. RIVERA:  It's okay.\nMRS. BAILEY:  -- there's been a lot said.  I've been \ntrying to take notes.\nMR. RIVERA:  It's all good. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Just real quick, when I -- when I \ntake a look at -- specifically, I currently reside in the 7th JD.  So, some \nof my questions might be more appointed to that.  I know you've been \ntalking about the 8th --\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure, sure.  What county do you live \nin?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n99MRS. BAILEY:  I'm sorry?\nMR. RIVERA:  What county?\nMRS. BAILEY:  When you -- as far as how the \njustices were assigned, did you say that constitutionally you have to \nassign the judges with -- when we're redistricting, or were they just \ndecided that that's where those individuals were going?\nMR. RIVERA:  The -- the Constitution lays out that \n-- that, you know, it authorizes us to do this at -- at -- at, you know, \nten year increments and that it lays out -- we have to -- you know, we \nhave to determine where the current judges go.  So, yes, I suppose. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So, constitutionally.  And \ndid I hear you correct when you indicated that some of that \ndecision-making was based on where they reside?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  I just -- because I was trying \nto figure out, you know --\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, forgive me.  When I say \"reside\" \nI mean where -- where they preside, like where -- where -- where -- \nwhere they actually -- where they work.  Where they're seated, I \nshould say.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  So, where -- so, in the case of \nMonroe County, it would be down at the Hall of Justice.  Is that what \nyou're referring to?\nMR. RIVERA:  No.  What I'm saying is what we took \ninto account was seniority and where they actually conducted work.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n100So, it's if a person, for example, was in Erie County, we kept them in \nErie County.  We didn't move a person from Erie County to Monroe \nCounty, in other words. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  But if you took folks from \nMonroe County and moved them to the 7th -- or to the 15th Judicial \nDistrict, that's taking them out of Monroe County when we created the \n15th JD.\nMR. RIVERA:  Say that again?\nMRS. BAILEY:  I -- I guess maybe I didn't \nunderstand your -- your answer there.  So, there's justices that reside in \nMonroe County currently, right now --\nMR. RIVERA:  That are judges in that judicial \ndistrict, yes.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  -- that are judges in the 7th JD.\nMR. RIVERA:  Okay.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Currently the 7th JD, what was it, \n20 -- 20 justices -- Supreme Court judges, it goes down to 13.  When \nyou create the 15th District, we have 13 seats and then we shifted \nsome into the 5th District, which is going up to 14 seats.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  The total number of judges \ndoes not change amongst the 4th Department in its entirety.  What's \ntaken into account is that the -- there is kind of -- there are points \naround the minimum needing to be 50,000 people in order to have a \njudicial district.  So some counties are much larger than other counties \nand when you take into account the population, that's how the judges \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n101were distributed. \nMRS. BAILEY:  I completely understand that.  I was \njust trying to figure out how the judges were assigned to the different \ndistricts and I'm still trying to wrap my head around that. \nSo, if we use where they were when -- when the \nmethodology came out to assign folks to the 5th JD, or to the 15th JD, \ncoming out of the 7th JD, it's my understanding if, I heard you \ncorrectly, you spoke with an administrative judge, who I presume is in \nthe 8th JD, who helped you delineate where the other judges were \ngoing to be -- where their new judicial district was going to be.\nMR. RIVERA:  Well, I -- I suppose when it comes to \nthe 8th and 15th Districts, it's really about population size.  So, in the \nCounty of Erie, as I said before, is about 950,00 people, give or take.  \nSo, you know, what -- what made sense is to bring together the, you \nknow, surrounding counties under the next judicial district.  There's \nnot much, you know, past that considering that, you know, it -- it \nwould be similar size by population, but, you know, once you remove \nErie County from the judicial district, it was such a -- a mass majority \nof that judicial district that the remaining counties combined made \nmore sense to have another district. \nMRS. BAILEY:  I'm not -- my question isn't \nspecifically how, my question is how the judges were assigned to \nthose judicial districts once we took the 7th Judicial and shrunk it \ndown now to where we have 13 justices versus the 20.  So, those six -- \nor those seven individuals, I only counted six that I could find, but \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n102those -- so those six or seven individuals have now been disbursed \neither into the 15th JD or the 5th JD.  So, my question is, how did we \ndelineate that methodology?  \nMR. RIVERA:  The majority of the circumstances, it \nwas based by seniority and then there was other considerations as in \nwhat judges started in the appellate, but in -- in general, it was about \nseniority. \nMRS. BAILEY:  I apologize, I missed the part about \nabout the appellate.\nMR. RIVERA:  That within -- within the 4th \nDepartment there's appellate judges and we grouped the appellate \njudges together.  But, outside of that, everything was really about \nseniority.  How long they had been in office. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And the only reason why I \nask is I looked at two individuals that I know, one is on the -- the \nsouthwest end of Monroe County, they're getting moved to the 5th JD.  \nAnd then one who is on the northern east part of Monroe County is \ngetting moved down into the 15th JD.  So, I'm just trying to figure out \nas far as, you know, how -- how they were assigned.  But I'll go onto \nmy next question and point. \nSo we talk a lot about population and I completely \nunderstand the population and how that works out and we see that \neven here when -- when our districts are realigned, when population \nand then you look at square miles.  Was there anything considered \nwhen -- when different counties were grouped together to create, you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n103know, the -- the two new districts when we're looking at square miles \nwithin the JDs now?\nMR. RIVERA:  I mean, square miles, no, but what I \nwould say is, you know, even currently if -- if we're just looking at, \nyou go, the old 7th District, you know, if you lived in Southern \nSteuben County and you would've had to go all the way up to -- to \nNorthern Monroe County in Rochester.  I mean, it -- it was -- it was a \ndistance in its old format and it's a similar distance by the nature of \npeople just being spread out and populations being where they are and \ncounty's lines being where they are.  It -- it's sort of unavoidable.   \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  The 5th JD is now almost \n10,000 square miles.  The 15th JD is just shy of 7,500 square miles \nand as I indicated, those judges that we've assigned coming out of the \n-- the 7th JD and where they're located, now we've just added more to \ntheir commute.  So obviously not knowing where they are going to sit \nOCA can, you know, in all honesty, OCA could say, you're going to \nbe up in Monroe County.  You know, if they're in the 15th, or the 5th \nJD -- \nMR. RIVERA:  They could do that today with, or \nwithout this bill. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Absolutely.  Yup.  I completely \nunderstand that.  I'm just trying to figure out how they were assigned, \nwhere they were assigned and I think you have answered my questions \nin and around that.  So I appreciate it very much.  Thank you. \nAnd on the bill, Madam Speaker. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n104ACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  On the bill. \nMRS. BAILEY:  I don't want to reiterate what my \npeers have already said, but it is interesting that we are here hurriedly \nto discuss this bill when OCA specifically has asked to maybe pause \nit.  There's been other legislation that this Body has done that with and \nwe continue to discuss it over and over and over again.  I won't get \ninto the energy mandates because we'll talk about those, I'm sure, you \nknow, over the next few days, but it is truly concerning.  I completely \nunderstand, you know, it's our constitutional right if we want to \nredistrict judicial districts.  Absolutely.  But speaking to an \nadministrative judge, I'm not sure we're getting a full appetite for what \nthe thoughts might be.  That is very concerning to me, and when I \nlook at the judges that have been assigned to various spots, the \nelections that are coming up this year, there are elections for two \nSupreme Court judges in the 7th JD.  Where do they -- where do they \nfall?  You know, where are they going to go?  Do they now just take \nspots of the seat that is vacated?  Is that how they're allocated?  What \ndoes that look like?  So, I think we really need to take our partners \nhere when we're looking at OCA, speak with the administrative judges \nand -- and if we're going to do this, let's get it right.  Let's not just \narbitrarily put something out there. \nThe other piece is the expense.  The staff and the \nresources that are needed for each judicial district is immense.  \nHaving served in my prior position, I worked with our Supreme Court \njustices on a daily basis.  I worked with those judge -- those justices \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n105coming out of the -- the 7th JD on a daily basis and I worked with \ntheir support staff.  I worked with the district staff.  There are many \nmechanisms that -- and many pieces that we really need to take a look \nat.  It is going to have a financial hit to us as a State and unfortunately, \nwe have not budgeted for it.  Will it be budgeted?  I would hope so.  \nBut where do we come up that money as we continue to see our \nexpenditures just continue to bulge, year after year.  \nSo, for those reasons, Madam Speaker, I will be \nvoting no. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nThe sponsor yields.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. \nRivera, I just got some questions, maybe some practical questions.  I'd \nlike to focus on the 8th Judicial District, since that's where both of us \nare from.\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure. \nMR. MOLITOR:  As you know, in the 8th Judicial \nDistrict, your interpreters, stenographers, clerks, commission of jurors, \nthose are all assigned out of Buffalo, right?\nMR. RIVERA:  At -- at the -- at, you know, at the \ndecision of OCA, I suppose.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n106MR. MOLITOR:  Yeah, but there -- for example, if I \nwanted to become a stenographer in the 8th Judicial District, I would \nbe assigned to Buffalo and then Buffalo would assign me out to \nwherever they think I need to go.  Isn't that right?\nMR. RIVERA:  That's how it is currently in the \ncurrent 8th, but in the new 8th, that might not necessarily be the case. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And that's what I want to \ntalk about.  In the -- in the new 8th --\nMR. RIVERA:  (Indiscernible) it might not be that \nway and it might not be that way and it might not be that way in the \nnew 15th. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Right.  So, how -- that's kinda \nwhere I want to -- where I'm trying to go is how would it work with a \nnew 8th and a new 15th?\nMR. RIVERA:  You're asking me how OCA would \nassign stenographers and staff in the new district?  \nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah, how would it work?\nMR. RIVERA:  The way that OCA does it today and \nhow it does it in every other judicial district. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So, right now, in the 8th Judicial \nDistrict, they're all assigned out of the Buffalo office?\nMR. RIVERA:  Because Buffalo is in the 8th.  How it \nwill be done in the 15th?  Presumably, OCA can choose to assign \nthem out of the 15th. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  So, this is -- this legislation \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n107would have no impact on how -- on the -- let's call it the home base of \nOCA staff for the different judicial districts?\nMR. RIVERA:  I mean, OCA can choose to have a \nsort of similar home base we'll call it, in one of the counties in the new \n15th. \nMR. MOLITOR:  But they -- and they can also, if I'm \ncorrect on this, they can also keep everything exactly as it is, keep the \nhome base in Buffalo and assign those -- those individuals out to \npeople in the 15th District?\nMR. RIVERA:  It's the will of OCA how they want to \nstructure how they staff. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And that's kind of the same \nway it is in maybe other parts of the State, right?  A judge might get \nassigned from one judicial district to another, staff might get assigned \nfrom one judicial district to another.  All that stuff happens under the \ndirection of OCA, which is a Statewide agency.\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  So, there's no concern --  \nyou don't have any concern that -- and this is really where I'm -- I'm \nkind of going; there's no concern that the staff that currently exist in, \nlet's say, my county, who are gonna go from the 8th to the 15th \nJudicial District, there's no concern that they're going to have to move \nto another part of the -- to a different district, or different part of the \nState, necessarily?  Or is that something you can't answer because \nthat's up to OCA?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n108MR. RIVERA:  That concern could exist with or \nwithout this bill because all of it is at OCA's discretion today.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay. \nMR. RIVERA:  If OCA decided tomorrow to no \nlonger have Buffalo be the home base as you put it and decided \nDunkirk to be it, then that -- we would have no say in what OCA does \nin that matter.  So, it would be no different.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And that's the way I \nunderstood it.  I just wanted to explain -- have that explanation on the \nrecord.\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Mr. Rivera, for \nanswering my questions. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. Manktelow.  \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield?\nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  He yields.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Mr. Rivera.  If \nyou could help me out just a little bit.  We've talked about diversity \nhere on the floor for the last couple hours here, in and out of this \ndebate.  Can you explain to me what they means as far as what we're \ntalking about from this judicial change?\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n109MR. RIVERA:  Sure.  I mean, I -- I described it \nearlier around, you know, racial demographics of a region, but I also \ndescribed the nature of residing in a more rural county and not being \nrepresented.  So, diversity as, you know, as it is, it -- it -- it means \nmany things.  And for example, you know, the -- the example I used \nearlier I think was Allegany.  You know, if I am a resident of -- of \nAllegany which is perceived to be a more rural county, as a lot of \nUpstate New York State is, the likelihood that I would have a judge \nwho represents my community, from my community, as a member of \nthe Supreme Court is very, very slim.  In my own research, it's been \nabout 40-ish years from what I've heard and that's just one example of \none county.  So, I think that no matter how you cut it, the what we're \ndoing today ensures a higher likelihood of people from counties \nseeing folks that represent them and more closely who they are. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  Thank you.  So, \nwith the changes, the Monroe County will be its own county.  It will \nthen be the 7th Judicial District; is that correct?\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  And what -- with what you \njust told me -- told me, how does that benefit Monroe County?\nMR. RIVERA:  It benefits Monroe County because to \ndate, despite being very, very diverse ethnically, they have still, in its \ncurrent form, have not elected, or currently do not have a single \nmember of the Supreme Court that is a minority.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Is -- I'm sorry.  I couldn't hear \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n110the last thing.\nMR. RIVERA:  I said despite Monroe County being \nvery, very diverse, especially in comparison to the neighboring \ncounties of the current judicial district, this -- it -- it -- it is still yet to \nbeen able, or been afforded the -- the ability to be -- to -- to elect a \nmember of color to the State Supreme Court.  Currently, there is none \nin the entire 4th Department, there is only two members of color, both \nonly in Eire.  So I believe that the people of Monroe, one, are going to \nbenefit from the potential diversity of the court, but, also, two, that \nalso means that if you're a Monroe County resident, you will be seen \nby a judge from Monroe County, not a judge from a neighboring \ncounty wherein which the nature of the county, the demographics of \nthat county, the -- the way that that county, you know, exists being \ndrastically different from Monroe.  We're ensuring that people from \nMonroe have -- are gonna be in front of judge that is aware of the \ncommunity there and what it's comprised of. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  So right now the \n7th Judicial District repre -- represented by Cayuga, Livingston, \nMonroe, Ontario, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne and Yates counties as -- as \nwe are today.  Most of those counties will now go to the 5th Judicial \nDistrict which will consist of Oneida, Oswego, Herkimer, Jefferson, \nLewis, Cayuga, Ontario, Seneca, Wayne and now Yates counties.  \nNow, we'll be going to ten counties.  So, I look at this and we talk \nabout diversity.  Is diversity -- to me, diversity should be a -- a \ntwo-way street; is that not correct?\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n111MR. RIVERA:  How do you mean?  \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So let's say this goes through \nthe way you're talking about.  Now we have a set of judges in Monroe \nCounty; okay?\nMR. RIVERA:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  They're going to be based out \nof Monroe County, they're going to service the people that are in \nMonroe County and not any of the other districts, or any of the other \ncounties pretty much; correct?\nMR. RIVERA:  Well, I would say, yes, but remember \nthat OCA does have the ability within the -- within the 4th \nDepartment to place judges in other places, so.  But, in general, yes. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Okay.  So have you ever \nfarmed?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I have never farmed, no. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Have you ever run a business?\nMR. RIVERA:  The closest I've been to running a \nbusiness is I was a banker and had many, many business clients, but \nno. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  Well, my question \nhere is, a lot of times when we as farmers contract with construction \npeople, people that buy our grain, they're really based out of the city \nareas, not so much in the rural areas where the farmers are.  And some \nof them are even based out of the Rochester area which consists of \nMonroe County and other parts of the area.  So, with this change and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n112we're going to take a farmer now, that there have been lawsuits, the \nwill be other lawsuits, will now be based out of Monroe County \nbecause that's where the business is that we are going to be involved \nwith.  If we change the makeup of the judicial represen -- \nrepresentation, how is that person -- how is that farmer going to get a \nfair shake if by what you said, we need to change the makeup of the \njudges so they know who they're do -- dear -- dear -- dealing with.  \nNow, as a farmer, I'm gonna go to Monroe County and I'm going to \ndeal with the judge that knows absolutely nothing about farming, or \nthe agricultural area, or a rural area.  How do we fix that?\nMR. RIVERA:  I guess, I would say number one, \ncounty judges still remain, so I don't know if the matter would go to a \ncounty judge versus a Supreme, so that's one thing.  And I'd also say, \nthis bill ensures a high -- a much higher likelihood that you'd be in \nfront of a judge that is aware and more present in your community and \neven potentially from your community.  The way it currently is, is that \nif you're from Steuben County, you're dealing with a judge in Monroe \nCounty.  That's -- that, you know, that's what we want to sort of, I \ndon't want to say avoid, but that -- that's what we're looking to \naddress.  Now, if you're from, you know, Wayne, Oswego, Jefferson, \nOneida, you're one district and the likelihood that the matters before \nthose folks in those counties are similar, I think are higher. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  Well, I believe if \ntruly part of this change is the diversity and getting people in front of \nthe right people, or having the ability, that -- that has to be a two-way \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n113street.  We can't just block off Monroe County and anything that \ncomes out of a lawsuit that's gonna end up in Monroe County, that \nmeans we're going to have judges that we're going to be in front of \nthat know nothing about our businesses, that know nothing about the \nbackground of agriculture.  How -- how is that fair?  How is that being \ndiversified?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I -- I honestly look at the new 5th \nDistrict and -- and really perceive it to be very, very, you know, as a \nperson who has toured just about every county in the State of New \nYork, I would look at the 5th District and say, for rural matters, I \nwould much rather, you know, for awareness of the needs of the rural \ncommunity, the 5th District actually looks far better than the old 7th \nDistrict.  But I -- I'd also say for anybody, you know, the -- the -- so, \nthe hypothetical scenario is, you know, how do we sort of explain this \nto somebody.  The -- the bear, you know, the -- sort of the boiling \ndown of it all is, you know, we have an authority as the State \nLegislature to pursue this at any time.  These district lines have -- have \nexisted long before you and I were here and have not been addressed.  \nI have called an array of attorneys and judges that are retired now to \nask what their take is, at least in the case of my judicial district, which \nis the 8th and asked them, when was the last time we pursed changing \nthis?  And half jokingly and what I think might be true is, it -- it might \nhave been the turn of the century.  So there's no way we can justify not \nchanging lines in response to an ever-changing population, by simply \nkeeping it the way we are -- or the way it is.  I find that argument to be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n114undefensible [sic] like, we have to make a change here and I think that \nthis bill before us is a -- is a respectful and common sense way to do \nit. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So, maybe you've answered \nthis question and I apologize if -- if I ask it again.  Who actually drew \nup the new lines?  Who -- who -- who drew them up?\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, well, you know, I mentioned it \nbefore, I -- I originally had a bill last year that touched my judicial \ndistrict.  Other members had bills that -- that touched their judicial \ndistrict.  We came together knowing that we could only do this once \nevery ten years, put it together in a single bill.  The -- the -- to boil it \ndown in its simplest form how we came up with -- with these districts, \nyou know, we believe that there are population dense urban center \ncounties.  Those counties we felt had sufficient population to \nnecessitate their own district and then we -- we -- we -- we carved \ntogether the neighboring counties to form other districts.  As I \nmentioned before, the State Constitution is clear.  We -- we -- we can't \ndivide counties, so entire counties obviously have to be kept whole.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I understand \nyou can't divide -- divide counties, but sometimes the way the lines \nare drawn up and if we're truly looking out for the people of this \nHouse that we represent, I just feel these lines could be just a little bit \ndifferent.  And just giving you the example, it -- it may be \nhypothetical to you, but in the real world, that's the way it works.  \nSo, I appreciate you answering the questions. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n115Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  On the bill, sir.  \nMR. MANKTELOW:  I think that's one of the \nproblems we have in this House.  We -- we sometimes forget the \npeople that we represent back home, the people that are going to be \ngoing to these judicial courts to be in front of a judge and I think it's \nour job to provide them the best service possible.  And we are again, \nnow going to silo certain groups of people, certain counties, into silos.  \nWe had one county versus ten counties and I know it's rural.  You \ncan't tell me we can't divide it up a little bit better than that so there's a \nmix?  So there is a true meaning of diversification across the court \nsystem, not dealing with just one city?  Why not deal with a city and \nseveral rural counties to make it truly a diverse way of doing the \njudicial work in New York State.\nSo, I appreciate the time of the sponsor answering my \nquestions, but I do believe in a rural area, there needs to be fair \nrepresentation across the board because much like many lawsuits, \nwe're probably going to end up in a large city whether it's Buffalo, \nRochester, Syracuse, Albany, New York City, it doesn't matter.  We're \nprobably going to up there from a rural area down the road.  \nSo, thank you, Madam Speaker, for your time. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, Mr. \nManktelow.  \nMr. Tague. \nMR. TAGUE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n116sponsor yield for some questions, please?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. RIVERA:  For you, certainly.\nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  The sponsor \nyields. \nMR. TAGUE:  I do just for the record want to know \nthat I can attest to Mr. Rivera traveling across the State of New York, \nbecause he traveled with me on my farm tour and I thank you -- \nMR. RIVERA:  Of course.\nMR. TAGUE:  -- very much for doing that, Mr. \nRivera. \nThe first question I have is, how many judges' names \nare spelled out in this bill?\nMR. RIVERA:  Every judge -- every judge of the -- \nof the 4th Department that are -- that's affected by this.  So all of them. \nMR. TAGUE:  So now my understanding is that 66, \nbut isn't there 67 -- \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, but --\nMR. TAGUE:  -- in that district?  Didn't judge Doran \nwho resigned in March, isn't he also listed?  \nMR. RIVERA:  There's one vacancy, yes. \nMR. TAGUE:  Are there any laws restricting a venue \nfrom bringing election cases? \nMR. RIVERA:  Say that again, I'm sorry.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n117MR. TAGUE:  I said, are there any laws restricting \nthe venue from bringing Election Law cases?\nMR. RIVERA:  If -- I'm unaware of that.  Not -- not \nto my knowledge, no. \nMR. TAGUE:  So what about Election Law 16-101 \nthat requires constitutional election cases be brought in certain \nparticular counties?\nMR. RIVERA:  I'm taking your word for it. \nMR. TAGUE:  Okay.  So, under this bill, if someone \nbrings a challenge to the Election Law in the 4th Department, what \ndistrict would they have to bring it in?\nMR. RIVERA:  As you said, Erie. \nMR. TAGUE:  Correct.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yup, yup, yup. \nMR. TAGUE:  Well, let me ask you this:  are there \ncurrently any Republican just -- judges elected from Erie County?\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, sure. \nMR. TAGUE:  Could you name them for me?\nMR. RIVERA:  I can't confirm the affiliation of every \njudge, but I know that there are some in the 8th Judicial District, yes. \nMR. TAGUE:  Okay, because my understanding was \nthere were no judges in that judicial district for -- actually from Erie \nCounty.\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, no, there -- there are.\nMR. TAGUE:  Okay.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n118MR. RIVERA:  As you could imagine, I've gotten a \nlot of calls this week, so I'm certain there are. \nMR. TAGUE:  Well, would you say that there's a \nlarge majority of Democratic judges from Erie County?\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, I don't know if that's true.  I \nwould say, I -- I haven't done a sort of a polling of who's a Democrat, \nwho's a Republican.  What I will say is, I know that the enrollment of \nErie County is -- is Democrat, but in my experience, a lot of the \ncounty offices that are held in Erie County, it's never been entirely \nDemocratic.  For example, there's only been two Democratic county \nexecutives ever elected in Erie County, there's only two.  Majority of \nthem have been Republican.  Only one or two county sheriffs in my -- \nat least in my lifetime, for Erie County.  So, it -- it -- it's a mixed \ncounty where we will elect both Republicans and Democrats to \ncountywide office. \nMR. TAGUE:  But you're sure that there are Supreme \nCourt judges in that judicial district that actually reside in Erie \nCounty?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, certainly.\nMR. TAGUE:  Not just -- not represent Erie County, \nbut reside in Erie County?\nMR. RIVERA:  I'm certain of that. \nMR. TAGUE:  As you said before, I'll take your word \nfor that.\nMR. RIVERA:  Thank you, sir.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n119MR. TAGUE:  Madam Speaker, on the bill.  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  On the bill, sir.  \nMR. TAGUE:  Listen, in this bill we've already put \nforum shopping in law and now you're putting judge shopping in play.  \nFirst, you told us where you can take the cases, now you're telling us \nwho can hear the cases.  My friends, we sat here today, we hear again \nabout racial and diversity, but to me, the judicial system should be \nabout judging people on their character and whether they've \ncommitted a crime, or not.  Not their race, not where they live, not \nwhere they come from.  Judges are supposed to look at everything \nindependently.  To me, I can tell you right now, there are lawyers \nsitting around a table right now waiting for the vote of this bill and I \nam sure that the constitutionality and how this bill came about, there \nwill probably a law -- there will probably be a lawsuit filed today, or \nin the next few days, once it goes through both Houses, if the \nGovernor signs it.  But I don't understand why we politicize the \njudicial system.  Everybody in this room knows that this -- the only \nthing that we didn't talk about today was the politicization of the \njudicial system and that's exactly what this bill right here does.  It \npoliticizes the judicial system.  This says that we're going to only have \njudges of one certain party in (indiscernible) area, hearing certain \ncases.  And I just -- I, you know, I -- I just can't believe it. \nMadam Speaker, I will -- even though my respect for \nthe sponsor of this bill I'd call a dear friend, I -- I will be in the \nnegative on this bill and I hope my colleagues that care about \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n120democracy and care -- actually care about the judicial system, will do \nthe same.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, Mr. \nTague.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  Will the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  The sponsor \nyields.   \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you.  I -- I heard \nyou mentioned earlier and in fact, I knew for sure that you had bill in \n-- on this specific topic designed for the 8th district to change in a way \nthat makes Erie County a district on its own.\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct.  Last year.  \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  How -- how old was that \nbill?\nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, it -- that was from last May.  So \nit's been over a year. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Over a year.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  Give or take.\nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  And you also mentioned \nthat our colleague from Monroe had a similar bill -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n121MR. RIVERA:  Correct.\nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  -- how old was his bill?\nMR. RIVERA:  Quite some time, and I know it \nwasn't done in -- in the last -- it -- it's been awhile.  I don't know the \ndefinitive (indiscernible) \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  So these are not new \nthought processes --\nMR. RIVERA:  By any means, no.  \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  -- these are things that \nhave been thought about before and have been given some \nconversation to.  I guess the next question I will ask is:  Do you know \n-- I heard you mention more than once that twice your age and the \nspeaker's -- the person that you were talking to's age.  How old is this \nprocess for establishing these districts?\nMR. RIVERA:  It's a good question, because it is a \nbit of a moving target.  I've asked -- what I was -- what I was going to \nsay earlier and it's sort of stark how bad it is; I spoke to a -- a --a \njudge, or a retired judge, who is now, you know, mid '70s and I've \nasked him, you know, you've been practicing  a long time.  Before \nbeing a judge, you were an attorney.  How long has the judicial \ndistrict -- our judicial district looked this way?  And he said -- he \nthought it was turn of the century.  He thought it was, you know, \nbeginning of the 1900s is the last time that our district where we live \nhad been, you know -- and the trouble is, it -- it's -- however old it is, \nit's so far back that we don't really have accessible records to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n122determine when it was.  That's how far back it's been.  Decades upon \ndecades. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Okay.  Well, you know, \nI -- and I think you're something like 200 and some-odd years.  \nMR. RIVERA:  I believe it.  It could be the founding \ndistrict that never changed.  It quite possibly can be.  \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  And I'm sure you know, \nas I know, things do change after 200 or so years.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, they do.\nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  In -- in pretty significant \nways.  I guess the other question I want to be clear on is that the \ncurrent judges who sit in State Supreme Court for this particular \ndistrict, how many of them will no longer be a judge because of this \naction we're taking today?\nMR. RIVERA:  All of them remain as judges.  That is \nunaffected and they are able to fill their full terms. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Okay.  Thank you very \nmuch for you comments.\nOn the bill, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  I had the occasion to go \nto a memorial service for Judge Sam Green's wife, Ernestine Green.  \nQuite a pillar.  I mean, this young lady was really a -- awesome \ncommunity member.  She was a retired teacher, an amazing \nfundraiser, a former chair of many very influential boards in and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n123around Western New York.  And her husband, Judge Green, was the \nfirst African-American man to be a State Supreme Court judge in that \ndistrict.  And for, I'm going to guess 70 years, he probably was the \nonly one.  And that's not because qualified judges of color, either \nthey're Latino or African-American, did not run for these offices, did \nnot be educated, get in a position where they could become a judge at \n-- at lower levels, they wanted to go to the next level.  Some of them \nspent as much as $250,000 trying to win a race and in all of these \ncounties.  I actually supported some of them and went with them.  \nAnd I mean, I went into communities that I had never been in before \nand most of them were not receptive.  And I didn't -- I wasn't with the \nperson who was spit on during a parade while they were trying to get \nvotes, I wasn't with that person.  I'm really glad about that quite \nfrankly, because it wouldn't have been pretty.  My point here is that \nwhen things -- time changes, things change, we ought to be amenable \nto some level of change.  Now, since Judge Green is clearly retired, \nthere has been at least a few other people who have made it to that \ncourt.  One of them almost spent $300,000 just to get there.  Not \nbecause it's a $300,000 job, but because it was her goal.  It was her \ngoal.  It was her mother's goal.  They actually wanted to go to the \nhigher courts and it took her three elections to do that.  And one of -- \nall three of those times she did have the support of the Erie County \nparty.  But she did not have the votes in those other counties, in and \naround.  And because of that, it took her three times to run.  And so to \nme, this is not just about diversifying opportunities to run for office, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n124it's -- it's -- it's a lot more than that.  It's -- it's about the justice that we \nsay is for everybody.  The liberty that is for everybody.  Well, if it's for \neverybody, you can't say I got to go to Eaton in order to get elected, \nwhen I know the people of Eaton are not going to elect me because \nthey're going to elect their cousin.  \nSo I want to commend the sponsor of this legislation.  \nThis is hard -- this is hard -- this is something hard to do, because \npeople don't want to see this kind of change when we talk about \ninclusion, for real, for real.  This is inclusion for real, for real.  And \nmaybe if there isn't an upcoming election and a Latino woman runs \nand doesn't win, we can't say she didn't have a chance.  We can say \nshe did have a chance and she just didn't win, because the most \nqualified judge won, or the one that the voters wanted the most won.\nIn the City of Buffalo, in the County of Erie, we have \nwanted new judges at the Supreme Court level for decades and have \nnot been able to get it.  This might be our opportunity and I want to \nthank the sponsor for introducing it.  I look forward to voting for it.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Ari Brown.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. A. BROWN:  Like my colleague, Mr. Durso, \ncertainly not a lawyer, I swing a hammer for a living.  I sat back and \nfigured the lawyers will work this whole thing out and I heard \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n125questions going back and forth; is this bill -- does this bill have \nanything to do with racial redistricting, racial gerrymandering?  I \nheard yes, I heard no, I heard the question asked a thousand different \nways.  It was kind of, it may be, it was, but thank God it would -- it \ntook my two colleagues, Assemblywoman Walker and our esteemed \nMajority Leader to point out that it's exactly what this bill is all about.  \nRacial gerrymandering.  Racial gerrymandering violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the 14th Amendment if race is the predominant \nfactor in drawing district lines.  It's a Supreme Court precedent in \nMiller v. Johnson, 1995 and Bush v. Vera, 1996.  The court held that \nrace cannot be the predominant factor in drawing any district, \nincluding judicial districts.  \nAnd for that reason, Madam Speaker, this bill \ncertainly won't pass judicial muster and I will certainly vote -- be \nvoting in the negative and thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Chang.\nMR. CHANG:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, sir.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. CHANG:  To be honest, I'm not familiar with \nUpstate New York district.  I live in Brooklyn and know my life is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n126Downstate -- \nMR. RIVERA:  Come on down any time.  Come up. \nMR. CHANG:  Out of the question with my \ncolleagues and arguing about the 8th Judicial Districts and whatever \njudicial district and Erie County.  Which I -- I have an idea where it is, \nbut I don't know exactly where it is.  But, how will that factor in -- in \nmy community of Asian community with a population of New York \nState represented by nearly 12 percent?  New York City gets nearly \nthree-quarters of it.  How would -- how would judicial redistricting \nactual balance out my community in Upstate?\nMR. RIVERA:  You're -- you're asking more or less \nhow does this potentially affect the Asian community in Upstate New \nYork?\nMR. CHANG:  That's correct.  If it's so few judges, I \n-- I don't know how many Asian judges are that -- 67 there are.   \nMR. RIVERA:  I can tell you that in the 4th \nDepartment, which is the department that sort of are the districts that \nwe're talking about.  Currently, there are no judges that identify as \nAsian, or Hispanic.  What I will say is, just using my county as an \nexample, I used some of these numbers before but I'll give you the rest \nof them, it's that, you know, this district, the current 8th Judicial \nDistrict, serves about 1.5 million people and 61 percent of them reside \njust in the one county of Erie.  And Erie County is the primary home \nfor communities of color within the district, representing 90 percent of \nits Asian population of the entire judicial district are in one county.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n127So it's staggering.  It's 83 percent of the Black population and 68 \npercent of the Hispanic population are all located in one county.  That \ncounty being its own judicial district, presumably, means that there's a \nhigher probability that a person of color could seek the office and -- \nand potentially be elected.  That's sort of the -- the numbers of it, is \nwhat I'd say.\nMR. CHANG:  As you mentioned a little earlier, that \nthis hasn't been redistricting for many decades from your research --\nMR. RIVERA:  Correct. \nMR. CHANG:  -- so, before you go -- I mean, I don't \nmind change, change could be good.  But, have you decided perhaps \ncreate a comission to -- to make this study, other than just a -- this bill \nand make this drastic change without further study?\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I -- I guess what I would say \nis, the -- the State Constitution is clear that the responsibility for \nmaking these, you know, I guess creating new lines is wholly on the \nLegislature.  And I would say that, although there has been countless \nmembers of these legislative bodies that have come and gone in the \nlast, what could've been 100 plus years, they've never taken this up \nand there's a reason why they've never taken it up.  It's because some \npeople don't want change.  It's because there's some people that simply \nbenefit from the nature of how these current districts are drawn and I \nbelieve that over time, it's -- they have become less and less reflective \nof the communities found within them.  So, it -- it -- it's taking an act \nof this Body to move under its constitutional duty to address it.  I -- I  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n128think waiting another year would be unwise, especially considering \nhow stark the problem is in our Judiciary.\nMR. CHANG:  Because it has definitely unintended \naffect because it will change the resources, manpower, real estate, \neverything when you start changing the districts itself.  I mean -- and \nwe have to budget for these -- for these costs as well.\nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I -- I would say, unlike other \ndivisions of State Government, OCA has a really broad set of abilities \nto determine and -- and allocate resources to regions that they feel are \n-- are needing of it and that doesn't change here.  You know, the -- the \n-- the budget of OCA is what I'm told to be near -- near $3 billion.  \nWhat we're talking about here in costs is potentially not creating new \njudgeships, not building new buildings, we're talking about the -- the \n-- the small incremental amounts it -- it -- it -- that are absolutely \nnominal, not just in the face of the grandness of our State Budget, but \ncertainly even in the grandness of the OCA budget.  So, you know, if \nwe were having a conversation of creating a lot of new judgeships, I \nwould agree.  But that's not what we're doing here.   \nMR. CHANG:  You know, we lost populations for a \npast decade.  About more than a million, I believe.  And \n(indiscernible) unintended effect.  But, you know, previous case, old \ncases may be residing in one district and potentially have to relocate \nthe other judge.  I'm not sure you're able to grand -- grandfather those \n-- those old cases that still impending. \nMR. RIVERA:  Yeah.  I guess I would just say that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n129the actual judges themselves aren't changing.  Obviously, if they \nchoose to retire or -- or they're aged out, that would be different.  But, \nyou know, the judges and their cases that they currently have, they'll \ncontinue to have with -- with minimal disruption, truthfully.  And \nremember that OCA does have the ability today, with or without this \nbill, to allocate a judge in County X versus County Y today, and this \ndoesn't change that.  So I -- I perceive the disruption to be very, very \nminimal. \nMR. CHANG:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. \nRivera.\nAnd on the bill, please. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. CHANG:  I think we can kill several birds with \none stone if we want to do this redistricting of judge during every \nannual -- every ten years when we do a redistricting our Assembly.  I \nthink we should marry up the same time because it's a process that -- \nbecause we have a Commissioner every ten years to -- to -- this is \nredistricting.  We don't need to do this in between the ten years.  We \ncan wait for a few more years.  I mean, we waited for at least several \ndecades or more, maybe 100 years.  We can wait a few more years \nuntil we lined up during the redistricting year, and perhaps we can do \nthis all in one big -- one big -- one big draw. \nThank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Walsh. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n130MS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Yes, of course. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  So I -- I read \nthrough the whole bill and I also read the Memorandum of Support, \nand a few people have referenced that.  But in the Memorandum of \nSupport that you provided with the legislation, there's a justification  \nsection and it specifically says that this bill aims to address that \ninequality, and because you had just cited some statistics about \nparticularly racial -- a lack of racial diversity.  You say this bill aims \nto address that inequality by establishing two new judicial districts in \nthe 4th Judicial Department.  So I guess -- and I don't think anybody's \nreally asked you this, maybe directly -- or as directly as I'm gonna ask \nyou.  How do you believe that this legislation will remedy racial \ninequality?  \nMR. RIVERA:  Oh, because as the numbers that I \nstated before, within each one of those judicial districts, the current \njudicial districts, the uniqueness about them is that each -- not -- the \nthing that makes them all similar is that in each one of those three \njudicial districts, a -- a central dense -- densely-populated diverse \ncounty exists.  An urban center exists within that entire judicial \ndistrict. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n131MS. WALSH:  Yes. \nMR. RIVERA:  So allowing that single county to be \nits own judicial district does address it, in my opinion. \nMS. WALSH:  But how so?  I mean, the -- the way \nthat Supreme Court judges are elected is unique.  It's not like the way \nthat we're elected.  As you mentioned before, there's a judicial \nconvention.  There are judicial delegates that go to a judicial \nconvention.  Those judicial delegates, there are petitions passed to \nselect those judicial delegates.  So have you done any looking around \nto see whether -- what -- what's the diversity like for judicial delegates \nright now, and how do you think that would change after this \nlegislation?  Because isn't that exactly -- I mean, isn't that your \npremise is that if we have racially-diverse judicial delegates that will \nthen result in a racially-diverse slate of potential judges to be elected \nby this urban center in this district?  \nMR. RIVERA:  I -- I would disagree that the issue is \nwith the judicial delegates entirely.  I -- I would say the issue here is \nwith the judicial -- you know, folks that are seeking the office of a \njudgeship  today.  There are people fully aware and fully capable of the \n-- the ability to -- to seek a judgeship  in either A, they perceive \nthemselves to be outside of that process, just as much as I'm sure that \nthere are people that perceive themselves to be outside the process for \nmany offices.  But especially this one, under the thought that just \nbecause, you know, you come from a -- a neighborhood, a \ncommunity, a county that has many, many similarities \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n132demographically to you, because you're lumped in with eight other \ncounties, in some cases even more other counties, it -- it minimizes \nthe -- the probability of being represented by someone from your \ncommunity.  And I'd say that, as I said before, from somebody from \nAllegany County.  You know, if you're from Allegany County, the \nprobability that you are represent -- or you will be seen by a judge \nfrom Allegany County is -- is highly, highly improbable.  So that sort \nof, you know, representation issue exists in the urban centers and it -- \nand it exists in the rural parts as well.  So I think that, you know, \ntaking into account the changes in population that have happened over \nthe last century, it's -- it's clear why we have the issue we have in the \n4th Department of only having two judges in the entire 4th \nDepartment being people of color. \nMS. WALSH:  All right.  I -- I mean, I'm just saying \nthat if -- if judges candidate -- if judge candidates are selected at a \njudicial convention by judicial delegates and those judicial delegates \nare White, I don't know if they are or not.  That's why I was asking \nyou.  But, I mean, isn't that how you get to the candidate on the ballot \nis through a convention?  So --  \nMR. RIVERA:  I guess I'd disagree --\nMS. WALSH:  Oh, okay.\nMR. RIVERA:  -- that just because a judicial delegate \nis of one race they wouldn't be likely to support a person of a different \nrace.  I -- I guess I disagree with that position.  I -- what I will say is, \nas long as the judicial districts look like the way they look, we will  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n133forever gonna have the problem that we have currently.  I'm not \nlooking to change the process by which we elect judges and the \nmechanics of how parties put judicial delegates in petitions.  That's a \nprocess that exists, and it's -- it is what it is.  I find the people that \ncollect petitions to be reflective of the communities that they're from, \nand that's fine.  I would say if the end result is what we have today, it \nis insufficient.  And the reason that I think it's insufficient is because \nwe've been comfortable with these lines as they've been for the last \ncountless amount of decades and that's where the problem is. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Well, let's say that another ten \nyears -- I mean, the previous speaker thought it was a great idea that \nwe should maybe redistrict every ten years.  I don't think I really agree \nwith that.  But let's say in ten years we look and we don't have any \nmore racial diversity as a result of this legislation.  Would you then \nintroduce a bill that would say that, Well, now it looks like we got to \nlook at the judicial delegates now.  We've got to make sure that there's \nracial diversity with the judicial delegates because obviously it's not \nresulting in more judges, which is what our goal is. \nMR. RIVERA:  I guess if the premise is that I'm here \nin ten years, it's to be seen.  But what I'd also say, not jokingly, is that \nthese terms are 14 year terms.  So that also has to be taken into \naccount, too. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right.  Well, thank you \nvery much, sir.\nMR. RIVERA:  Sure.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n134MS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  So I want to just note at the outset, I \nmean, this is a really important debate and it's just come to my \nattention, I'm so sorry to report that the live feed from this debate cut \nout for an-hour-and-a-half.  So unfortunately for folks who were \ntrying to watch this being debated live, you missed a really big chunk \nof what was a very important debate.  So I really hope that when -- \nwhen this -- I think the last time it happened was when we were \ndebating Medical Aid in Dying, it also cut out for a period of time \nthen, too.  So I really hope that when the full debate is available to \neverybody who might want to watch it later, because it's a very \nimportant debate.  And I think it has a lot of implications, you know, \noverall.\nSo I want to say that, you know, I listened very \nclosely to all the previous debate that we've had, and what I found out \nis that in developing this legislation there was no consideration of how \nthis legislation might impact the Board of Regents.  There was no \nconsultation with LATFOR.  There was no consideration of court \nbacklogs.  There was no consideration of the Unified Court System's \nview that this legislation should be deferred until next Session, at \nleast.  There was no consideration of the Onondaga County [sic] Bar \nAssociation's concerns.  So I would ask rhetorically, since I'm on the \nbill, why are we doing this bill suddenly at the end of the Session?  \nThe -- the reason that was given and -- and has been talked about is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n135that we want more racial diversity.  We want to remedy the inequality \nthat there are only two judges that are racially diverse in this area. \nI would say this:  There are plenty of different ways \nthat we can try to -- and listen, I represent an area in Upstate New \nYork that is very White, and we are trying to -- it is, it's very White, \nand we try, through our local Bar Association and through a number \nof efforts in our county, to try to encourage people of color to get \ninvolved in our process who -- particularly attorneys that want to get \ninvolved.  And it -- it's -- it's work.  It's uphill, and it does -- it is \ntaking a while.  But I would say that the way that we try to get more \ndiversity on the bench is I think we need to start at a very grassroots \nlevel, trying to reach out to individuals who have recently graduated \nfrom law school, and try to engage them in the process.  And we know \nthat the process has got politics in it, right?  I mean, we can all say \nthat there's no politics involved, but there -- there are -- there's a party \nstructure that leads to a convention that then puts candidates up.  So \nwe need to encourage people of color to get involved in the political \nprocess, both sides of the aisle, and -- and try to have those people see \n-- see a future and see themselves being able to get on the bench.   \nBut the way that this bill is being done, unfortunately, \nis either, one, social engineering, or, two, playing partisanship, or, \nthree, both of the above.  Right?  So I don't think -- no matter how you \nslice it, this, to me, is a very offensive bill.  I don't believe that this can \nbe legal for the reasons that my colleague sitting in front of me \nreferenced in his discussion.  What do I want to see in a judge?  What \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n136do I think are the top qualities in a judge?  I want excellence.  I want \nthe best.  I want judges that are impartial.  That are independent.  That \nare rational.  That are fair.  That are reasonable, and that have a good \nknowledge of the law.  And I don't care -- I don't care, and I don't \nthink most people care, what color they are.  I -- we want excellence.  \nThat is what we're looking for.  How do we achieve that?  I don't think \nwe achieve that with this bill.  I don't think we achieve that at all.  I \nthink what we do is, as has been pointed out by others, is I think that \nthis really just creates a very cynical, very distrustful attitude towards \nthis Legislature and also the Judiciary.  I think that this is the absolute \nwrong way to go about this.  And, you know, I feel like a little bit that \nI, as one of only three women in the Minority Conference here out of \n47, I think I -- I speak, you know, from some experience.  I -- I think \nthat, you know, I wish that there were more women in my Conference.  \nI work towards that.  I try to encourage more women to run for office, \nto become engaged, to -- to see themselves.  I don't -- I personally \ndon't believe -- and I won't disclose my age because as my \ngrandmother said, you never ask a lady her age -- but I've -- I've been \naround for a while.  I've been practicing as an attorney for a while.  \nWhen I started practicing -- when I came out of Albany Law School, \n50 percent of my graduating class were women.  And then when I \nwent into trial work, when I did my first trials, do you know how \nmany women I saw?  Nada.  Nada.  We weren't there.  I don't know \nwhere the women went.  I don't know if they went into State service.  \nMaybe they went into different positions that have more humane \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n137hours.  I don't know.  But they certainly weren't in trial work.  You \nknow, did I say that I wanted there to be a certain, you know, quota, \nnumber of women trial attorneys?  No.  No.  I got in there and I did \nmy cases.  And I tried to be excellent and I tried to be the best attorney \nthat I could be, regardless of what my gender was.  \nSo I think that there is a way to encourage diversity in \nour Judiciary, in our Legislature, in business and our lives.  I don't \nthink that this legislation is the way to do it.  I -- and I do -- I do find it \noffensive and I will -- I will be voting in the negative along with, I \nwould assume, a -- a good number of us here.\nSo thank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nRead the last section. \nTHE CLERK:  This bill [sic] shall take effect \nimmediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  The \nRepublican Conference will be in the negative in this legislation.  Any \nother votes can be cast at the desks now.\nThank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n138Speaker.  The Majority Conference is gonna be in favor of this piece \nof legislation.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes to explain her vote. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker, to explain my vote.  Of course everyone knows I'm definitely \nin support of this, but I -- for the record, I would like people to \nunderstand that I have been a judicial delegate, as well, more than \nonce.  And for clarity, it's the 8th Western New York County Chairs \nfrom the multiple different parties that really break down what the \ndecision is when who's gonna be the person that runs for office, and \nwho's not only gonna be the person, but who's gonna get the support \nfrom their respective area.  \nSo again, I want to commend the sponsors of this \nlegislation and I -- I look forward to the results of it.  And there is no \nguarantee that it's going to elect judges of color because, quite frankly, \nthe only way to do that is for there to be a State Supreme Court race \nthat focuses just on one-half of Buffalo.  If we had that, they we can \nassure that.  But there's no way you assure it otherwise.  But there is \nan opportunity to elect people like that because I know the people who \nlive in the community and I know that they're open -- more open to \ndiversity than other communities are.\nThank you. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n139ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mrs. Peoples- \nStokes in the affirmative.\nMr. Bologna to explain his vote. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  As \nthe sponsor said a little bit ago when talking to Mr. Chang, that 96 \npercent of the Asian population in Western New York resides in Erie \nCounty, thus making the probability, I think, of racial diversity -- by \nconcentrating the judicial districts to just Erie County, it makes it \nmore probable.  By definition, that is racial gerrymandering.  In my \nview, it is unconstitutional based on the Equal Protection and Voting \nRights Act.  In addition to which the assertion that this would be a \nnegligible amount when the OCA is already saying that this is gonna \ncost $9.6 million.  Again, it's very frustrating to hear that during the \ncourse of a debate.  The OCA also says it costs about a million dollars \nto bring in a new judge.  We could have ten new judges in Western \nNew York for the amount that this is going to cost, and -- and kind of \nlet the chips fall where they may.  So that is, again, frustrating to hear. \nI have a feeling that we're probably going to be \nhearing from the Federal Gov -- Federal Government regarding our \nHAVA funding for racially gerrymandering judicial districts.  So I \nvote in the negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Bologna in the \nnegative.\nMr. Bronson to explain his vote. \nMR. BRONSON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n140rise to speak about this bill and to thank the sponsor for bringing it \nforward and for doing an excellent job during the debate. \nWe are constitutionally authorized to do this.  So all \nthe complaints about why are you doing this and, you know, we \nshould leave it for a different time, we have the authorization under \nthe New York State Constitution to do this.  \nI strongly believe that this measure will transform the \nSupreme Court in these various districts.  It will move the Supreme \nCourts to be move reflective of our communities and our counties.  It \nwill, indeed, allow us to elect a more diverse bench, which we do not \nhave in Monroe County, and a bench that reflects the community.  \nAnd, you know, I think we'll get there because our delegates reflect \nthe community.  This is not gerrymandering.  This is recognizing that \ndense populations in these particular counties have not been \nrepresented.  Those communities have not been represented, and it \nwill help us. \nI will share from a retired judge from the community \nwho wrote me when this bill was introduced, which combines a bill \nthat I carried previously.  This bill does the job in transforming the \nSupreme Court in our region.  Over the long run , the Judiciary  in our \ncommunity in Monroe County will better reflect who we are as a \npeople and who we are as a community . \nOnce again, I thank the sponsor.  I thank the Speaker \nfor bringing this forward, and the team and our staff for making this \nsuch a good bill. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n141Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I vote in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Bronson in the affirmative.\nMr. Chludzinski to explain his vote.\nMR. CHLUDZINSKI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nI rise to explain my vote today.  After hearing this debate to go on for \nseveral hours, it's -- it's very clear that this is an unnecessary bill and \nit's very divisive.  Gerrymandering of our judicial system, while it uses \nthe -- the text of this being to increase diversity, it's obviously judicial \ngerrymandering.  The only color involved here is red and blue.  And \nwe shouldn't be using that for -- our judicial system shouldn't be based \non -- on political ideations.\nSo for that reason and many others on this bill, I'll be \nvoting in the negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Chludzinski in \nthe negative.\nMr. Ra to explain his vote. \nMR. RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  So just \nquickly because I ran out of time earlier, I want to point out as we talk \nabout this as if it's, you know, a issue of -- of race.  The fact of the \nmatter is, many of these judges get cross-endorsed in the current \nsystem.  And so that means that even on the side of the aisle that's \npushing this bill, leadership politically has chosen not to nominate \nindividuals that you're saying would reflect the community to the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n142bench.  So I don't know why that is.  But I think that's something that \nneeds to be pointed out.  Even earlier this week, the Senate went \nthrough a confirmation process.  There were Court of Claims judges, \ninterim Supreme Court judges appointed that the Governor prioritized; \njudges who were more reflective of the -- the communities made up \nfor in these districts.\nSo let's be realistic about what this is.  It will make \nsure that, in particular, one district that we have now restricted the \nability of New York State residents to bring constitutional election \nchallenges, it'll essentially make sure that there is one party in every \nsingle one of those judgeships  and they will be the only one that will \nget those -- those cases.  Let's be realistic about what we're doing here.\nI vote no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Ra in the \nnegative.\nMr. Meeks to explain his vote. \nMR. MEEKS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  The \nhonorable great Martin Luther King, Jr. once stated, \"The time is \nalways right to do what is right.\"\nI want to commend the sponsor on this legislation.  It \nis absolutely necessary.  I look forward to these things being \nimplemented.  Truthfully, it will not happen quick enough; however, I \nsupport this legislation, I'll be voting in the affirmative.\nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Meeks in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n143affirmative.  \nMr. Molitor to explain his vote. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  You \nknow, when a -- a court stenographer or an interpreter applies for a \njob within a district, the -- the job opening is under that district.  And, \nyou know, I have a lot of problems with this bill, but one of the, I \nthink, unintended consequences of this bill is you're severing rural \ncommunities from their population centers.  And I think you're gonna \nmake it harder for those districts in rural commun -- the judicial \ndistricts that represents rural communities from having enough \nqualified candidates to staff their courts.  I think it's gonna be a real \nproblem.  I think it's a -- a major unintended consequence of this bill.  \nFor all the reasons cited, including this one, I'm voting in the negative.\nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Molitor in the negative. \nMr. Burroughs to explain his vote. \nMR. BURROUGHS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I \njust -- at times I like to always delve in reality.  And so when you hear \nof times of people speaking of change, to me and many others that \nmeans they have a hard time with moving forward to changing things \nfor the better.  And so I have to commend the sponsor for this bill, \nbecause for me, this change represents something positive throughout \nthe State and particularly his district.  \nAnd so when we hear the word \"gerrymandered,\" I'd \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n144just like to recite some words, put my teacher's cap back on.  \nWhenever the term \"gerrymandered\" is discussed, typically it's the \nother side of the aisle who has committed gerrymandering in order to \ndisproportionately give themselves an advantage in political \npersuasion.  So with that being said, when we hear these terms being \nthrown out, we have to know that gerrymandering usually doesn't help \nthe Democratic side.  It's always being addressed to help the other \nside.  So I would like to just be someone who delves in reality and say \nwhen you hear these words, let the words apply to what it actually \napplies to, and in this case it doesn't.  We're actually trying to fix some \nof the rights and the social ills that have gone on throughout this State \nand in the country for hundreds of years.\nAnd so for that I am voting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Burroughs in \nthe affirmative.\nMr. Reilly to explain his vote. \nMR. REILLY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Just a \npoint of clarification.  I think there were some maps that were thrown \nout in New York State for gerrymandering, and I got news for you, \nthis side of the aisle did not have control.  \nSo I will be in the negative on this bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Reilly in the \nnegative.\nMr. Lemondes to explain his vote. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n145rise to explain my vote.  I listened to the debate very carefully, and I \nwanna -- I -- I wanna highlight the comments made from both sides.  \nBut the most important thing said here today was the comments from \nour Floor Leader, Ms. Walsh.  And I want to hit the -- the notion of \nprofessional ethics and the need for impartiality.  And this took -- this \ntook -- this debate took me back to my military career where over \nthree levels of command and 27 years of time, I adjudicated hundreds \nof disciplinary cases from every ethnic group in this country and never \nonce had anything challenged.  And there's at least one former JAG in \nhere that would say, Hey, that's a pretty good accomplishment .  So the \n-- the -- the notion of this gerrymandering and the perceived necessity \nof this change is completely based on -- on reasons that -- that don't \nmake sense.  And I think that if we were true with ourselves and really \nprofessional, I would hate to think that any Black judge or any White \njudge or any Hispanic judge would adjudicate circumstances before \nthem any differently based on the person that was before them of a \ndifferent race.\nThank you.  I vote in the negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Lemondes in \nthe negative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nPage 15, Rules Report No. 699, the Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A08871, Rules Report \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n146No. 699, Dilan, Forrest.

DILAN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  This bill \nwould enact into law, if signed by the Governor -- it is an omnibus bill \nthat would enact 11 -- or ten bills and 11 ideas, legislative ideas, into \nten parts and they all vary by issue -- issue area. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. DiPietro. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. DILAN:  Absolutely. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Thank you, Mr. Dilan.  Let's start \nwith on Section J there's some things where the incarcerated will have, \nis it up to three years after they're released to possibly bring any \nactions?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, so if -- if I may, a second, Mr. \nDiPietro, in my opening I omitted that the -- the main goals of the bill \nare to achieve accountability, transparency and oversight in light of \nthe two homicides and many other untold others that we've seen \nrecently.  So specifically to your question --\nMR. DIPIETRO:  Yeah.\nMR. DILAN:  -- if you could repeat it for me, I'm \nsorry. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n148MR. DIPIETRO:  Oh, yeah.  On Section J it says they \nwill have the ability, the incarcerated individual, the ability to file \nwithin three years after release from custody a Notice of Claim or \nNotice of Intention to file a claim related to civil actions to recover \ndamages for both physical and/or psychological or other injuries.  I \njust want to double-check.  So it's three years from release date?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, so I take it you mean Part J, not \nSection J.  \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Yeah.\nMR. DILAN:  And yeah, I guess the -- the idea \nbehind this was as a safety measure.  From time to time incarcerated \nindividuals will choose to remain silent about any potential abuse that \nmay have happened to them while they were under custody.  So if \nthey choose to do so, as a safety measure currently the statute of \nlimitations is running on them.  So by the time they're released and \nthey deem themselves to -- to be safe, they may have lost the -- the \nopportunity to bring an action.  So, yes, this does give them three \nyears upon their release to commence one. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  When you're talking physical or \npsychological on a -- are those -- to be able to bring a suit or action, \ndo those have to be documented at the time when they are \nincarcerated?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I think if the -- the -- and I'll dis \n-- for clarity, it was initially sponsored -- a bill sponsored by Council \nMember -- excuse me -- Assemblymember Cruz.  I think she could \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n149speak to more to her intent.  But the way it appears to me, it is a safety \nmeasure.  So I believe it doesn't have to be documented because if \nthey document it, that is the trigger for an incident that might put them \nat harm and, therefore, jeopardize  their safety.  So I would -- I would \n-- no, it doesn't have to be.  They can -- they can commence it \nafterwards. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  How will -- what will be the \nparameters on proving that someone on the physical side was harmed?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  So there's no specific \nrequirement, but obviously, they'd have to, you know, be able to prove \nthat it has happened and the ordinary pleading requirements still \napply. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Okay.  So -- so I'm just trying to \nsort this through.  So let's say hypothetically an inmate has an \naltercation --  \nMR. DILAN:  An -- an incarcerated individual. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  An incarcerated individual has an \n-- has an altercation with a CO or another inmate.  If another inmate \nhas -- does physical damage, can they still sue or bring action against \nthe State, being another inmate-on -- excuse me, incarcerated \nindividual versus --  \nMS. WALSH:  A point of order please.  Point of \norder.  \nMR. DIPIETRO:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n150MS. WALSH:  We need to not have this conversation \ngoing on in the background throughout this whole debate.  Would you \nplease, Madam Speaker, admonish the gentleman to -- to the back of \nme to please keep his mouth shut, please?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  We will have \nquestions and answers only during the debate.  Outside conversations \nshould be taken outside of the Chamber.  If you wish to speak, put on \nyour light and we will call on you when we get to your turn.\nMr. DiPietro. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  Sorry, Mr. Dilan.  The incarcerated individual, if it's \nincarcerated individuals on an incarcerated individual, is that grounds \nalso for an action?  \nMR. DILAN:  Any actions that have to do when \nthey're in custody.  So potentially, yes. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Okay.  So incarcerated individual \nattacks an incarcerated individual and, say, hurts him in the arm or in \nthe leg.  And obviously it heals up and he's fine.  But how -- how \nwould that go if he comes out -- when he's released, how will you -- \nwill you bring an action and -- and how would that work?  Would he \njust say, I was injured by another incarcerated individual?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes, it -- it would be the same as -- as \nany other -- the same as if he wasn't in custody.  The same as it would \nbe on -- on the outside.  But what -- what this would do would give \nhim, you know, the three-year period -- give him or her, excuse me, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n151the three-year period if they think their safety's at risk to delay that \nproceeding. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Does it change the -- the degree of \nproof?  \nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  It doesn't?  \nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  So this is -- is -- I guess I look back \nto a -- a bill we passed a number of years ago, I think you were here, \nwhere it's the look-back bill.  And I know this is only three years, but \nI'm just looking at -- so without any proof there were -- there were \npeople claiming that they had been abused 50 years ago by someone \nof the clergy, and they were getting these settlements.  And now I \nknow this is only three years, but is that -- are we -- is that a parallel \nthing because of the fact that the claim is being made without -- \n(Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMR. DILAN:  I think I know where you're going.  \nThere -- there's no look-back provision in this bill.  It would only be \neligible at the time it becomes effective under the section. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  So, just because I'm trying to be \nclear.  The -- that's physical damage.  Psychological damage, I -- I \nwould think that anyone who is incarcerated, actually going behind \nbars -- I've toured every facility in my district and others outside my \ndistrict -- it's pretty intimidating.  And I would think that most \nincarcerated individuals would be able to claim some sort of mental \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n152tragedy by being in there.  What -- what degree does it have to be to \nbring that?  \nMR. DILAN:  So we're -- we're really not adding \nanything new.  Currently, if they want to bring these claims now they \ncan.  The problem that I believe the sponsor's looking to address is \nthat if they opt to -- if they opt to choose silence as a safety measure \nbecause they're afraid of -- of what may happen to their physical \nperson, they can choose to delay commencing that action three years \nafter their release.  Everything else about it, you know, doesn't change.  \nIf they want to commence an action while in custody, they certainly \nhave the right to do so.  This doesn't take that away.  \nMR. DIPIETRO:  I'm just -- \nMR. DILAN:  It would -- it would be similar, if I go \nfurther, as an elected official, you know, the statute of limitations on \nanything we do doesn't -- that clock doesn't start until we're out of \noffice. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  So -- so I appreciate that.  I just \nlook at -- I'm not -- I'm not questioning the three-year period, okay?  I \nunderstand why that's -- that's in there.  But I'm -- what I'm trying to \nget to is what are the facts that are gonna be presented in front of a \njudge or a jury from this incarcerated individual to prove that there \nwas physical or psychological damage so that they would be able to be \n-- to get an award?  \nMR. DILAN:  This section doesn't change any of \nthat.  All -- all the section really does is a give them an additional \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n153three years post-incarceration.  So whatever facts or protocols or laws \nthat are currently on the books will remain.  The only additional \nbenefit, if -- if you will, is for them to choose to protect themselves, \nbut not miss out on, I guess, commencing the proceeding that they \nwould still have to prove an additional three years after they're \nreleased. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Okay.  Understood. \nIs there -- under current law, is there a limit to \nrewards or monetary values that they can receive?  Is there a limit?  \nMR. DILAN:  I mean, I -- I guess what I'm hearing is \nthat it's out -- it's really outside the -- the scope of this bill.  I guess \nthere -- there would be -- under current law, it would be like any other \nproceeding that could be commenced, whether in -- incarcerated or in \nthe -- in the free world.  So the difference is really (indiscernible/ \ncross-talk).  \nMR. DIPIETRO:  So you're not trying to -- you're not \ntrying to change that aspect of the law that's current, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  We don't change that at all. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Okay.  That's what I wanted to see. \nIs there anything that -- can you expand on, is there \nanything that improves the safety of the corrections officers?  I know \nthere's a few things in there, like with the cameras.  Can you expound \non those?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I mean, as in the case with \nRobert Brooks, I mean, it's long been the sense of a lot of folks who \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n154have had family members who are incarcerated and have had them die \nand -- and maybe thought they were murdered but couldn't prove it \nbecause there were no cameras.  I think the -- the profoundness of \nRobert Brooks' murder is that it is probably the first one that was on \ncamera for the entire State and the entire world to see.  And I believe \nwhat everybody saw, they -- they can't unsee.  So the cameras \npotentially could do the same thing for any type of assault or murder \nof -- of any kind, whether it is incarcerated-on-incarcerated, whether \nit's officer-on-incarcerated individual.  So the cameras show you what \n-- what they show you.  It's not intended to benefit one side or another.  \nIt's intended to give us more transparency, which is why it's important \nto the -- to the title of the bill because we want to deal with the facts \nof what happened.  And we also don't want to allow, you know, any \nentities to basically hide or -- or change the facts of what actually \nhappened. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  There's a -- no, I agree, and I've \ntalked a number of corrections officers who are in favor of more \ncameras because -- for their safety.  So I'm -- it goes both ways, it's a \ntwo-way street. \nMR. DILAN:  Listen, if the -- if -- if cameras improve \nsafety for everyone I think that's a laudable goal.  I also hope and I \nbelieve it's the hope of many others that having the additional \ncameras, both fixed and body-worn, will be a deterrent on abuse of \nimprisoners and -- and hopefully a deterrent on murder of incarcerated \nindividuals. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n155MR. DIPIETRO:  So -- thank you.  With the -- when \nthis bill was getting put together, were there any discussions that you \ncould alleviate [sic] or -- or expound on that had to deal with the \novertime issue with the corrections officers?  Was that ever discussed \nin bringing any of this together?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, that's -- no, that's a function of \nthe Executive.  You know, we tried to stick to, you know, our -- our -- \nthe legislative aim.  We -- we -- the legislative functions.  We looked \nat agencies that, you know, clearly were -- were broken in terms of \naccountability and transparency.  But to get into functions that the \nExecutive needed to do with their labor force, we -- we did not \nconsider that.  We left it to them. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Okay.  Now, I -- I appreciate it, \nMr. Dilan.  I appreciate those answers. \nOn the bill, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  I want to thank my colleague.  This \nbill, it just -- when I look at when we were trying to alleviate some of \nthe tragedies that have happened on both sides between the \nincarcerated individuals and the corrections officers, I just don't think \nthis bill goes far enough.  The -- it does nothing to address the main \ncauses of the strike that -- that got the attention of the entire nation, \nand those were the mandatory overtime and the HALT Act.  So this \nbill, I -- I think it could have gone a lot further than it does.  It does -- \nI guess it does put some parameters in place.  I just expected when we \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n156were told -- when we knew the Majority was working on this that -- \nthat we expected a little bit more.  It just doesn't seem to follow that -- \npardon?  Yes.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Go ahead, Mr. \nDiPietro. \nMR. DIPIETRO:  Okay, thank you.  The -- the main \npart -- parts obviously, which were very aggrievous [sic] was the fact \nthat this strike was not about money and that the Governor threw \nmoney at it.  When I talked to some of the negotiators, they were just \ndumbfounded.  And I want to tell you a story that I was told \npersonally by one of the mediators.  And it was on that week when \nthey were going to mediation Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  And \non Monday night while this strike was in full blown, the Governor \nwent out in public and said, I don't know why they're striking , to \nwhich the mediators on both sides, from what I was told, went \nballistic.  They called her and talked to her, and they said, You can't \nmake statements like that.  But when we settle this , we all got to be \ntogether.  When the corrections officers come back , we've got to put \nthis all to bed .  And what I was told specifically was that she was \nadamant that they were -- she wanted them to be put in jail, everyone \nwho struck.  And that was just very, very, very disheartening to hear \nthat.  And the one quote that stuck with me that this gentleman said, \nhe said, On both sides of the mediation , he said, We were the adults in \nthe room.  \"We\" were the adults in the room .  That the Governor was \nso adamant and so petty to make sure that these officers were put in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n157jail and were never gonna work in New York State, and we've seen \nthe results of that, that -- they could not believe it.  And so that's just \none.   \nThe other is, you know, there's -- it goes both ways.  \nThere's -- there is a gentleman who died on the job a couple of months \nago, three months ago.  He was -- because there was a posting that \nsaid if he took time off, if any corrections officer called in and tried to \nuse sick time or call time off that they would be terminated.  And that \nwas posted and they have copies of that.  Well, this gentleman was \nforced to work a 24-hour shift followed by 16, 16, 16, 16, and was -- \nand he kept telling from day one that he didn't feel well.  He told his \nsupervisor and he was told that he would lose his job, so he kept \ncoming to work and he died at the facility.  There's gonna be a \nlawsuit, I think, pretty soon on that one.  So this is how bad it got.  \nThe -- the HALT Act, which was not the main reason \nthey struck, because it was all about the overtime and being away \nfrom their families.  If anyone had been following this, there were \npeople, they had not seen their families -- they'd go 16 hours and then \nthey would go home, sleep, get up and work another 16, come back.  I \ngot so many stories of corrections officers who were not able to put \ntheir kids on the bus, had to hire babysitters and neighbors to come \nover and watch their kids for weeks at a time, unable to see their \nfamily or get their kids to school, pick them up, be with them on the \nweekends because they were forced into working.  This is unheard of.  \nAnd this is where we should have been putting the focus on \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n158remediation for these corrections facilities.  That's one of -- one of \nthem.  \nThe other is the HALT Act, from all -- every \ncorrections officer in -- that I've spoken with.  That -- that was \nprobably the biggest tragedy and that's probably why we're here on \nthis bill.  But if we did not have the HALT Act, every corrections \nofficer will tell you, that gentleman probably would be alive today \nbecause of his actions when they were transferring him -- and again, \nnothing's going to make any of that any better or justify anything they \ndid.  But the fact is as soon as there was an issue they probably would \nhave put him in the SHU for 24 hours or 48 hours and that never \nwould have happened and he'd be alive today.  And every corrections \nofficer will tell you that.  So the HALT Act did the exact opposite of \nwhat it was supposed to do, and now we have a tragedy on our hands.\nSo with that, Madam Speaker, there's so many other \nthings but I know I want to leave -- I want to let others have a lot of \nother questions on this.  And I just wish that this had addressed more.  \nIt's a start, this bill.  There are some good things in it.  But overall, it \ndoesn't go far enough.  It's got some things that are negative, and I'll \nbe voting in the negative.  And I just wish it had -- we had done more \nbecause the entire situation has not been fixed and this was supposed \nto fix it.\nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Ari Brown. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n159MR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. DILAN:  If the question is germane to the bill, \ncertainly. \nYes.  Yes, I -- I yield. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Okay.  Thank you.  Under Part B, \nwhat is the estimated cost to State and local governments -- this is \nunder Part B, Section 4, lines 6 to 9.  Under Part B, what is the \nestimated cost to State and local governments of mandating long-term \nvideo storage in the correctional facility?  And how do you justify \nforcing counties to potentially spend -- you know, store tens of \nthousands of hours of footage for years with no funding mechanism?  I \nsay that because I did something like that on a smaller level, at a \nvillage level, to store meter footage for parking stall -- people backing \ninto parking stalls and it was a fortune.  This could run tens of \nmillions of dollars. \nMR. DILAN:  So I -- I would say to the question, this \nis -- had already been funded in the budget that we just passed to the \ntune of $400 million that we added for cameras in the budget that we \njust adopted.  So the funds can be taken from there.  As it relates to \nthe locals, this funding and this section replies [sic] only to State \nfacilities.  Locals are not included. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n160MR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor.  What --   \nthat being said, what do you think this portion of the storage of this \nunlimited amount of hours would cost, taken from the State's budget?  \nMR. DILAN:  You know, to speak to that, it was \nDOCCS that had submitted the cost to the Governor in the -- in the \naggregate of the 400 -- of the 400 million to speak to the detail to the \ncost of that.  I -- I don't -- I don't have the answer.  Maybe Ways and \nMeans has it.  But it's included in that cost.  And I believe the \ntechnology that they are using limits to some degree, not -- not \ncompletely, the amount of man hours it would take to do the storage \nand -- and the like. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Right.  What I was trying to say, \nnot to belabor the point, Mr. Sponsor, but the storage itself is very \ncostly.  I'm saying on a small scale for a little village it cost tens of \nthousands.  Is it millions? \nMR. DILAN:  Like -- like I said in my previous \nanswer, they're not included.  It applies only to State facilities. \nMR. A. BROWN:  I understand.  Thank you, Mr. \nSponsor.  \nAnother question.  Does this bill create any legal \nstandard or chain of custody for the video evidence, or are we just \nhanding over raw uncontextualized footage to the AG's political staff \nwith zero evidentiary safeguards, potentially opening up the door to \nmanipulation, leaks or selective editing?  \n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n161MR. DILAN:  Yeah, so it provides that if a -- if a \ncorrectional officer -- excuse me, if an incarcerated individual died at \nthe hands of an officer, that information has to be given to the AG.  In \nterms of the politicalness, it's the AG specifically.  It doesn't say the \nAG from which party.  Historically, AGs have changed parties over \ntime.  We've tried to keep this as apolitical as possible, and as much as \non the substance of the tragedy as possible, and tried to address the \ngaps in our agencies as much as possible.  I -- I think what most folks \nforget is that the AG wanted to try this case herself, and because of \nconflicts she couldn't.  Those conflicts arose because she was \ndefending corrections officers who had been excused of abuse of \npeople under custody.  So I think it's important to allow, you know, \nany AG -- and I understand your concern.  Like, we -- we are \npoliticians.  It can be political at times.  But this sends it to the newly- \ncreated unit of the AG's Office of Special Investigation.  Those guys \nare, you know, not politicians.  They're usually professionals.  And it \n-- it -- this legislation, which was worked on in part by the AG, you \nknow, certainly tries to protect the AG's Office, and they took careful \nconsideration to wall it off for many conflicts.  So I think they have \ngone a long way to try to view this as a substantiative matter because \nthey care about getting the -- the policy right.  And I know there's a lot \ngoing on in the national theater.  But I think this, you know, really has \nnothing to do with that.  Folks are just trying to get their agency's \nstructure right so they can do the jobs that they were elected by the \npeople of the State to do. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n162MR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor.  Maybe I \njust wasn't clear.  I hear what you said. \n(Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMR. DILAN:  -- interrupt me and we can save \n(indiscernible/cross-talk).  \nMR. A. BROWN:  You're entitled to speak.  I was \nreally getting into chain of custody of the video itself, because what \nhappens is it's stored where?  How does it get to the AG's Office?  We \ndon't have an Epstein-style --\nMR. DILAN:  It -- it's --\nMR. A. BROWN:  Hold on, hold on.  An Epstein- \nstyle situation where the video disappeared.  Who's taking ownership \nof it?  What happens to these endless hours of video?  Is it in the \nCloud?  Is it on a hard drive?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, so the -- the bill's not \nprescriptive in that manner.  It's up to the agencies.  Generally this \ndata is stored at DOCCS.  The part of the bill that you're speaking \nabout lays forward the guidelines for DOCCS that if an incident under \nthese guidelines happens, that's when they're triggered by law to turn \nthe information over to the AG's Office of Special Investigations. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor.  So let \nme ask, why should the State expose itself to this open-ended civil \nliability -- this is Part J, lines 30 to 32 -- by extending the statute of \nlimitations under Part J for years beyond incarceration?  I heard your \nanswer earlier, but even in cases where there's no physical evidence, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n163no witnesses, and no way for the defendants to protect themselves \nafter years.  I understood why your answer was good, but, you know, \nthere's a lot of circumstances where -- \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I -- I would say why would we \nallow someone to bring a proceeding while they're under custody and \nthey have to run the risk of bringing that proceeding at the risk of their \nlife?  I mean, what we want to do is give people as many -- as many \ntools that they can to protect themselves and keep themselves safe.  \nNow, some people may not elect to -- to care, and they certainly can \ncommence an action now.  But some people may say, you know, The \n-- the money or anything I may deserve as a potential award is not \nworth my life .  And some people at the moment aren't thinking about \nmoney at all, they're thinking about their life.  Our lives and our time \nis a lot more valuable than money.  But then after you are -- are \nreleased and you feel like you're safe, there is an -- there's, I believe, \nmany opportunities that have been missing.  I believe the sponsor \nbelieves that there's been many opportunities that have been missed to \naddress it. \nMR. A.  BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor.\nMy next question.  Doesn't granting the Correctional \nCommission [sic] Association access to sensitive -- sensitive facility \nrecords, personnel files, 24/7 entry rights without any judicial \noversight violate not only privacy laws, but also undermine basic \noperations, security and inmate-staff safety?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I would say this:  I mean, I'm \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n164glad you brought up the State Commission -- oh, CANY, sorry.  Could \nyou repeat the question?  I'm sorry, I got it confused with the State \nCommission (indiscernible/cross-talk) -- talking about CANY, I'm \nsorry.  \nMR. A. BROWN:  No problem at all.  Doesn't \ngranting the Correctional Commission [sic] or Association access to \nsensitive facility records, personnel files and 2/47 entry rights without \njudicial oversight violate not only privacy laws, but also undermine \nbasic operational security and inmate-staff safety?  \nMR. DILAN:  So, look, CANY -- CANY -- what \nwe're doing, CANY can do many of those things now.  We're -- we're \nexpanding the powers of CANY because historically, you know, \nCANY was founded in approaching almost 200 years ago.  CANY \nwas founded in 1844 by people of the State of New York who -- who \nwere private.  In 1844 it was citizens and they wanted independent \noversight of agencies back in 1844.  In 1844 there were, you know, \nour -- our prison system looked dramatically different.  And then two \nyears later this Legislature, you know, granted them that authority to \nmonitor that -- that you just prescribed to some degree and that we're \nexpanding today.  But what it says to me, something profound \nhappened before the Civil War in our State prison systems and, you \nknow, here we are today, almost 180 years later and we still haven't \ngot -- gotten our independent oversight systems as a State correct.  So \nthis is the first step out of many in an attempt to try to correct those \nissues.  So yeah -- yeah, I think it's founded.  Under the legislative \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n165authorization back in the 1800s, the Legislature granted them the right \nto do these reports and share and -- and -- and provide all these -- this \ninformation to the Legislature and the public.  And I would say in the \n-- in the recent incidents, it was the CANY report that was ignored \nthat led to -- to where we are today as a result of the murders.  And I \nwould say our actions here as a -- as a Democratic Body and as a \nlegislature weren't -- weren't to address a strike.  And I think we have \na difference of opinion as to why that strike was commenced.  But, \nyou know, I would say that in -- in -- in this instance, had CANY's \nreport been followed and more people would have been widely aware \nof what CANY does, potentially, Robert Brooks' murder could have \nbeen prevented.  Because their report clearly said that instances of \nabuse on incarcerated individuals was abnormally high as compared to \ntheir other reports that they had issued. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor.  One last \nquestion.  Under Parts A and F, how is it not a blatant con -- conflict \nof interest for the Attorney General's Office to investigate State \nofficers and employees while also defending them in civil suits, or \nworse, to refuse to defend them and bury the records under the guise \nof internal conflict?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, I -- I -- I'm glad you asked that \nquestion because that -- that, to me, is some of the structural flaws that \nwe have found since, you know, the -- the murder of Robert Brooks.  \nAnd then I would say one of my main concerns when we found out \nthe severity of -- of how bad it was, the first thing I noticed that there  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n166was a -- a report of a death in -- of an incarcerated individual.  Then \nwe saw the video and we clearly saw that it was more than just a \ndeath.  And then we got communications from the Attorney General's \nOffice that there -- there's a potential conflict because the Attorney \nGeneral may be representing some of the individuals who are -- stand \naccused of murdering Robert Brooks.  The Attorney General was also \ndefending them on civil -- on other matters related to abuse.  And then \na few months later, even though the calendar year was different, the \nsame thing happened with Messiah Nantwi, and the Attorney General \nhad to again recuse herself because she was defending herself on other \nactions -- or she was defending corrections officers for other \nallegations of abuse.  So in two homicides, the Attorney General has \nbeen, like, two for -- two for two in having to recuse because she has \nto defend folks who stand accused of -- of murdering incarcerated \nindividuals.  Now, the first question it leaves you to believe is how \nmany other instances of -- of abuse is the Attorney General defending \ncorrections officers on?  And I think that could be, could be a clear \nindicator of who your problematic corrections officers are. \nMR. A. BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor, for \nanswering my questions. \nMR. DILAN:  And I -- and I certainly hope she \ndoesn't have to go three for three. \nMR. A.  BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Sponsor, for \nanswering the questions.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n167ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. A. BROWN:  There's always the other side.  \nYou know, we have the incarcerated individuals and we also have the \ncorrection officers who put their lives at risk every single day.  So \nwhere in this bill is the protection for the correction officers whose \nsplit-second decisions, often under life-threatening circumstances, are \nnow going to be reviewed years later by activist lawyers with edited \nfootage and a political axe to grind?  There's absolutely nothing in \nhere looking out for them.  A blatant omission, and for that reason I \nwill be voting in the negative.  \nMadam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Maher. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield to questions related to the bill?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. DILAN:  Absolutely. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, sir.\nMR. DILAN:  Absolutely.\nMR. MAHER:  All right.  First I want to say in Part \nA, looking at the video disclosures and certainly other aspects of this \nbill where we're talking about the videos, I think that's gonna help in \nterms of transparency.  I think it's gonna be an area where you're \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n168gonna see, hopefully, encouragement in behavior.  So we're very \nhopeful.  I know a lot of us and a lot of COs that I've talked to, that if \nand when this implemented correctly, it can have a positive impact for \nsure. \nMy first question is related to when we talk about the \nincarcerated individuals and some of the mandates that are put on \ngetting that footage within 72 hours to the Attorney General's Office, \nOSI.  There are other similar issues, and I wanted to know if they \ncame in discussion when we were preparing this bill.  When it comes \nto correction officers that also have to create reporting to do their use \nof force policy, is there going to be a similar type of access for them \nwhen it comes to accessing video footage when some of their \nsuperiors or folks that they're supposed to be talking to question some \nof their writings in their use of policy -- use of force reports?  \nMR. DILAN:  So it wasn't -- it wasn't contemplated \nin this -- in this part of the bill. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Thank you for that answer.\nFunding.  I know that we talked about in the budget \nwhat was funded for body-worn cameras, and I believe there was a \nvery large number for -- for cameras also related to prisons in general.  \nI see there's a very, very aggressive plan here.  I just want to make \nsure that funding in this Capital budget is -- is gonna be enough.  In \nyour estimation, do you think it's gonna be an appropriation next year \non top of this year, or do you think it's properly funded in this budget? \nMR. DILAN:  It -- it may be properly funded in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n169budget, but if -- if the Executive determines they need more, I'm sure \nthey would have the opportunity to come back to us and make that \nrequest. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  I just definitely wanted to be \non the record.  It's -- it's a very aggressive plan.  These cameras are \nvery expensive.  There's a lot of places in the prison that are gonna \nhave interesting angles.  So we definitely want to make sure that we're \ncovering all of our bases and that it's properly funded, so that's good to \nhear. \nI want to talk about Part C, notice of deaths.  I just \nwant to make sure this is perfectly clear.  When -- this part requires \nDOCCS to promptly notify the next of kin and any other person \ndesignated as a representative of the death of the incarcerated \nindividual.  This prompt notification will include the circumstances \nsurrounding the death, the medical procedures used, and the cause of \ndeath including preliminary determinations as well as the final \ndetermination, reported by autopsy result -- autopsy results as such \ninformation becomes available.  Is this just for incarcerated \nindividuals or any death at a DOCCS facility?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. DILAN:  Any -- any incarcerated individual. \nMR. MAHER:  So this is not in relation to a civilian \nstaff or a correction officer who is -- is killed or dies in a DOCCS \nfacility?  This -- this would not account for them as well?  \nMR. DILAN:  No.  But to my knowledge, the last \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n170line-of-duty death for an incarcerated individ -- for a correction officer \nwas around 19 -- 1982.  This doesn't address that.  This just addresses \nincarcerated individuals. \nMR. MAHER:  Can I ask why we are only dealing \nwith a notice of death in correctional facilities for incarcerated \nindividuals and not correction officers, civilian staff, or even our \nNational Guard service members?  My thinking would be we'd want \nto try to put them on an even playing field in terms of their lives and \nthe value of their lives. \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I -- I -- this basically amends six \n-- Section 624 of the Correction Law's current law.  So we're not \ncreating a new section.  Current law leaves it at incarcerated \nindividuals and doesn't expand it to correction officers or \nnon-corrections staff.  So I think the intent of the sponsor on this bill \nwas to change the language to shall -- what does the language say -- \nshall contact -- shall -- (indiscernible/cross-talk) -- that's what it is \nnow. \nMR. MAHER:  I think it's 24 hours after the next of \nkin or designated representative have been notified of the death of an \nincarcerated individual, DOCCS must publish a public notice of such \ndeath on the Department's website; is that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  So the -- yeah, the employers have to \ndo the next of kin.  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the question because I \nwas getting -- could you repeat it?  \nMR. MAHER:  All right.  I think we're on the same \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n171page there, through.  But --   \nMR. DILAN:  I think so.  But I just want to make \nsure. \nMR. MAHER:  But it's just incarcerated individuals.\nMR. DILAN:  Yes.\nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you for your \nanswer. \nAll right.  Going to Part D, a study on DOCCS -- a \nstudy in deaths on DOCCS correctional facilities.\nMR. DILAN:  Yep.\nMR. MAHER:  All right.  So, I know these records \nexist.  I was looking up online, I was actually stunned by some of the \nstatistics that are online, so I'm assuming the purpose of this section is \nto get little bit deeper and get explanations.  For example, in 2023 it \nlooks like out of the 107 total deaths, zero accident, one homicide, 68 \nnatural causes, eight overdoses, 11 suicides, and then 19 unknown.  \nAnd then I look at 2025 it says 37 unknown.  So I'm -- I'm assuming \nthat the purpose of this is to get a little bit more information.  My \nquestion to you is, in your discussions of putting this bill together, \nwhy isn't this getting looked at a little deeper from DOCCS?  Have -- \nhave there have been any discussions as to how we got here in terms \nof not being able to properly get into the details of all of these deaths \nthat are occurring in any calendar year?  \nMR. DILAN:  So I -- I would say no.  And I think, \nyou know, this bill, this section has been around.  I believe I debated it \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n172last Session with Mr. Goodell.  And, you know, certainly since then \ncircumstances have -- have changed.  You know, certainly a lot of this \nis under the -- the -- you know, the deaths and -- and the reporting are \ncertainly on DOCCS' website.  That's some of the stats that -- that you \njust read off.  But SCOC does this.  So when we originally debated \nthis, we wanted to take a -- a holistic approach.  And then certainly \nafter what happened recently, we thought it -- it applied even more to \ndrill down on some of the answers -- or some of the questions you \nmay just -- that you just asked, so we thought it was appropriate and -- \nand put it in.  Because like you said, like we have, you know, a lot of \nquestions as to, you know, how those numbers read the way they read, \nand I think further information and further detail on these deaths in the \nfuture will benefit us all. \nMR. MAHER:  I agree. \nI want to get down to Part H and to follow up exactly \nwhen we're talking about the State Commission of Correction \nExpansion.  Look, I think this is -- this is a good thing.  There's two \nquestions that I have.  The first, why were there no Minority \nleadership appointments that we could also make for this?  Was there \na discussion on that?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, again, like I said earlier, the \nState Commission of Correction was established again at the end of \nthe 18th -- excuse me, in 1895, roughly.  And I think as it relates to \nappointments, the way the bill reads, it -- the Governor retains her \nthree that she has now.  That's the current composition.  The current \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n173language says the Governor appoints -- it doesn't say the -- the \nDemocratic Governor appoints.  Then next it says the Speaker of the \nAssembly will have two appointments, the President Pro Tem of the \nSenate would have two appointments.  We found that over time, \nSCOC -- legislation in around SCOC had been amended, and it had \nbeen sufficiently been amended by either party.  So if you recall the \nAttica riots in the 1970s, the Governor was Republican. \nMR. MAHER:  Right. \nMR. DILAN:  The Speaker of the House was \nRepublican.  The President Pro Tem of the Senate was a Republican.  \nAnd they enacted good reforms in -- in the wake of Attica.  It worked \nthen, and I -- I believe it will work now.  And when you -- the reason \nwhy I bring up the dates is that when you look at the context of the \nState of New York and how long the people of this State have been \ntrying to solve this problem, the individual party really, you know, is \ninconsequential.  Because Republican administrations have done good \njob -- done a good job in enacting reforms, and so have potentially \nDemocratic ones.  So the reason why there's none lined out is because \nthe way it's written, it's -- it's worked. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Your -- your point is -- your \npoint is well- taken.  I'll look forward to revisiting that when we have \na Republican Governor in a little while. \nMR. DILAN:  Well, and under a Republican \nGovernor, the policy will be the same and they would have the right to \nmake their appointments.  But, you know, it could take 200 years. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n174MR. MAHER:  Eighteen months?\n(Laughter)\nYeah, we'll -- we'll revisit that.  Thank you, sir.  \nOkay.\nI also want to talk about just reporting in general.  \nWas it discussed, talking about some of the injuries that are taking \nplace, again, with civil staff, the correction officers, with National \nGuard service members?  And also, was there any discussion to the \nreal serious issue going on within our State prisons in terms of \nfentanyl, other exposures that are creating hospital visits and even our \nincarcerated individuals and correction officers and civilian staff to be \nNarcaned , even, and to be taken to the emergency room?  I know in \nmy district alone there's been dozens of those cases.  I have four \nprisons within my district. \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, so while those are important \nissues that I believe should be addressed at some point, it's -- it's really \noutside of the scope of the bill.  It's about transparency, accountability \nand -- and oversight.  And again, like I said to -- to many of -- people \non the outside, this is the first step and they'll be ways for us to \nholistically look at our government agencies and government systems \nto address a lot of the problems.  But I think the intent here by us was \nnot to look at issues that are definitely problems, like drugs in -- inside \nour facilities are definitely problems. \nMR. MAHER:  Right. \nMR. DILAN:  Staffing problems and -- and issues on \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n175where they -- why they may or may not have gone on strike, you could \nsay it's a problem.  But our intent here was to strengthen our \ngovernment systems so that we could have better accountability on \nthese agencies, have better independence on some of the information \nthat flows from DOCCS, and better oversight just generally, and \naccountability, should they decide to, you know, take action -- actions \nthat are not prescribed by a judge. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you for that.  I -- I do want to \ngo on the bill, but I have one final question I want to ask.  When it \ncomes to discussion of the body-worn cameras and the need to have \nthem be sent to the AG OSI in 72 hours, is anything related to the \ncameras that were put in this bill, was -- was there a discussion with \nthe union, and is there a concern that there's an issue with the union \ncontract, should there had been some discussions with the union for \nany of these policies?  \nMR. DILAN:  No, but the union might have been, \nyou know, a little busy at the time.  But, no. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  All right.  I just wanted to \nhave that on record.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate the answers to my \nquestions.\nOn the bill, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.  \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  So, I really appreciate the \nanswers to my questions and some of the acknowledgments and some \nof the concerns, especially the -- the fact that there is a lot more work \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n176to be done.  I think that acknowledgement is important.  I do want to \ngive an appreciation to my colleague and many of my colleagues for \nsitting down and actually speaking to correction officers up here in \nAlbany who had legitimate concerns.  I hope to continue those \nconversations moving forward.  I do believe there are so many things \nthat we could have put in this bill that could speak to the staffing crisis \nand the safety concerns within our prisons.  It is dark right now within \nDOCCS in the State of New York.  The current state of our facilities, \nyou really have to go there and see it for yourself and talk to the folks \nand the families that are impacted.  It is devastating, and it is getting \nfar worse.  We still have thousands of National Guard service \nmembers throughout the State of New York.  We're spending tens of \nmillions of dollars on a regular basis to fund them, and we're having \nreal issues.  While at the same time, we have correction officers who \nare going to the hospital due to exposures.  One individual in my \ndistrict -- I'm not gonna use his name -- he hit his head, passed out due \nto an exposure, went to the hospital.  Ended up getting a TBI.  \nReported back for duty, wasn't able to go back to work.  Applied for \nlight duty, was denied and was recently fired.  While we have \nNational Guard service members doing administrative duties, we \ncouldn't find light duty for a correction officer and instead fired him.  \nAnd there are so many different issues happening since the work \nstoppage where we really are ignoring folks that want to be in an \nenvironment and do well in that environment and provide a public \nservice, and instead spending an -- an awful amount of money and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n177putting folks who are not trained in a position to potentially hurt \nthemselves and others.  \nWhen it comes to incarcerated individuals and the -- \nthe environment, we need to make sure that environment is safe for \neveryone.  And I'm going to continue to pursue that route, working \nwith our correction officers, our civilian staff, those that are \nincarcerated, their family members.  And I just want to warn my \ncolleagues; in the future when it comes to prison closures, we've really \nseen that not be something that helps the situation, but really only \nexacerbates it.  I really want to be mindful going forward.  I want to be \nable to work with everybody in a collaborative way.  But on the \nrecord, it's just really important when we talk about programming, \nwhen we talk all of these things that we need to fix, we can't fix them \nwithout appropriate staffing levels.  Appropriate staffing levels will \nremain in -- in crisis mode until we have a serious conversation with \nboth parties in the room, and right now I -- I don't think we're there.  \nI'm going to keep working and hopefully -- \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nMaher.  \nMR. MAHER:  -- we'll get there at some point.  \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Palmesano.\nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n178yield?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.  \nMR. PALMESANO:  Thank you, Mr. Dilan.  I -- I \nknow we've had a number of conversations offline, at hearings, and I \njust want to say right up front I -- I really appreciate how upfront you \nare.  I know this -- this issue has been very personal and very \npassionate for you because of the tragedies that happened with Mr. \nBrooks and Mr. Nantwi.  So -- and I know the one thing you said is, \nyou know, initially you were looking at this from a holistic \nperspective and because when we talked, and I know we had \ndiscussions, we talked about, obviously, there's what's going on with \nincarcerated individuals and violence inside our prisons.  But also, we \ntalked about the assaults and things like that that's going on with the \ncorrections officers.  Was there any discussion or when did -- was \nthere any discussion on trying to address that as part of this package or \nnot really at this time?  I know we've talked about HALT and the \nrepeal of HALT is not on the table.  But was there -- any of that \ndiscussion to try to look at this holistically, to look at the conditions \nthat the corrections officers and staff are working in?  \nMR. DILAN:  So what I -- when -- when you say \n\"holistically\" you're correct.  And not just me, myself and many of my \ncolleagues, many members of the Caucus, because a lot of this \ninformation derived from legislation that they introduced.  And I think \nthere are many things that the Caucus were [sic] promoting that, you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n179know, hasn't made it yet into a -- an omnibus bill or to this floor that \nwe -- we still support.  That included a holistic approach, too.  But I \nthink what we did here was, again, tried to see if we could at least get \na two-way agreement with the Senate on the systemic issues that \nclearly have not worked, to see if we could get a package that would \nimmediately stop the murders; get a package that, you know, could \nhelp reduce assaults; find out where our -- you know, our systems \nagain were broken, and you know address that.  There were many \nother conversations that we addressed via HALT.  You know, it \ncertainly has been discussed publicly, it's came [sic] up at hearings, it's \nbeen discussed privately.  I've made plenty of comment -- public \ncomments on HALT.  But this bill really wasn't considered to be a \nattempt -- an attempt to address or do anything as it regards to HALT. \nMR. PALMESANO:  I -- I understand. \nMR. DILAN:  In that regard, no. \nMR. PALMESANO:  I can understand that, though.  \nOn the issue of body cameras, I know this has come \nup a couple of times.  I know we have a policy that's kind of used, and \nthis is going to be taking a Statewide policy.  Does this bill do \nanything to ensure -- or is there gonna be regulations in place to \nensure -- number one, ensure proper training is received and that the \ncameras are maintained, equipment is properly maintained and \nfunctioning?  Does this bill address that or say anything -- speak to \nthat at all?  \nMR. DILAN:  So, this bill doesn't do that specifically, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n180but that was addressed in the budget that we just passed. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  Would this -- would this \nbill or what we passed in the budget just deal with clear guidelines on \nthe use of cameras or maybe lack of use?  You know, sometimes we \nhear about it being in sensitive -- sensitive areas must be considered or \naccommodated.  Does this bill address that or was this addressed in \nthe bill that we passed during the budget, or is this something that's \ngot to be looked at?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes, it does.  And then additionally, \nsome of the things that the Governor enacted after the -- the murders, \nsome of her initial actions that didn't require legislative actions would \ngo to do that as well. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  And -- and I -- and I do \nagree.  I think this use of body cameras is gonna be a good thing.  \nObviously, we saw the horrific abuse of staff on the -- the video \ncameras.  But also, this could be used in a way when on the other side \nthese video cameras will be able to capture things when maybe there's \naccusations are unfounded, accusations against COs by others, too, \nright?  So it's basically there to catch everything.  So I think the -- the \nvideo cameras is a good part of this bill, so I just wanted to mention \nthat. \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  And I would say, look, it -- it -- \nit works all ways, but I think we want folks -- the job is already hard \nenough, and for the folks who do the job the right way, you know, \nthey deserve protection, too.  But for the folks who are the bad actors \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n181and potentially give a bad name to everyone else that -- that's doing it \nright, you know, for the folks that are doing it right, they deserve \nprotection, too. \nMR. PALMESANO:  And I -- and I appreciate you \nsaying that because one thing we don't wanna do is paint everyone \nwith one broad brush, and that's why we want accountability and \ntransparency and I think this part of the bill I think is a -- is a good \nthing. \nI did wanna move on.  You know, we were talking \nabout the -- the Commission on Corrections [sic] and I -- I won't [sic]  \nwanna belabor the point on the Minority appointments.  I -- I get that.  \nI think what I'd probably say, and maybe I'll elaborate more when I go \non the bill, but I think the reason we talk about Minority appointments \nis because, you know, there might be differences of opinions on \ndifferent things, but to have a different perspective.  I mean, for the \nSpeaker to have two appointments, we get zero appointments.  I just \nthink that's something we should look at a little bit more, especially \nlike on -- on something like this that's so broad, omnibus.  We should \nhave that expert difference of opinions to bring those discussions \ntogether to get difference of opinions, whether they agree or disagree.  \nI think that's something we should keep in mind as we move forward.  \nSo it was more of a statement there, I guess, than anything there.  So I \njust wish that would be kept in mind. \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I -- I would say point taken, but I \nalso think it's important for the debate on this question is that CANY \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n182also gets two appointments and they're non-political.  They're not a \nmember of either -- either side or either party in House. \nMR. PALMESANO:  And I can under that -- \nunderstand.  I saw, like, you have the composition must include at \nleast one member from a different area groups.  You know, it could be \na person formerly incarcerated at a facility, a health professional, a \nbehavior healthcare professional, an attorney.  A professional in any \nother field useful in the promotion of humane -- is -- I guess my \nthought is, wouldn't a -- a retired corrections officer be someone -- the \nreason I ask that question is obviously they've seen it all.  They've \nbeen -- they've been inside the facilities.  They've seen the challenges.  \nThey've seen the opportunities.  They know where the problems is \n[sic].  Wouldn't it be -- wouldn't that be a wise appointment to have on \nthis commission?  Just because of the experience and background they \ncan bring from a diff -- again, from a different perspective than others, \njust like when we talk about the Minority appointment. \nMR. DILAN:  So the way the language reads, and \nyou go that part right, the way it reads it says includes those \nindividuals, but not limited to.  So certainly if CANY or the Executive \nor any other entity that gets to make an appointment, whether it be the \nSpeaker, the President Pro Tem, if they wanted to include that they're \nnot prohibited from doing so. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  Just -- so I wanna just -- \nand I -- just to clarify the statute of limitations.  I was listening to the \ndiscussion.  So the way I understand it, if I'm correct, once someone, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n183an incarcerated individual finishes their sentence, they would have \nthree years upon finishing that to file a claim; is that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  That is correct. \nMR. PALMESANO:  And that is regardless if it was \na 10-year sentence, 20-year sentence?  Whatever it is, they have three \nyears after they finish, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Regardless of sentence, correct. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  And so they would have \n-- now, this question, and I think I know the answer but I just wanted \nto be sure to be on the record.  Now, would the -- a suit that was \nbrought back, would that be against the State of New York?  Could it \nfall back upon the corrections officer personally?  How does this \nlanguage adjust that?  Is it just the State because they were the \nemployer, or could the individual corrections officer be under this \nlaw, new law?  \nMR. DILAN:  So it -- it -- it's not specific.  You \nknow, certainly, if the -- the nature of the injury is against the State, \nthe State could be liable but it's not specific. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  Well, Mr. Dilan, thank \nyou for your time.  I appreciate it.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Madam Speaker and my \ncolleagues, at the Public Protection budget hearing in January at the \nfollow-up Joint Senate and Assembly Corrections Committee hearing, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n184public hearing on what was going on in our -- our prisons and prison \nsafety, I said right up front at both hearings that what happened to Mr. \nBrooks and subsequently to Mr. Nantwi was absolutely abhorrent, \ntotally unacceptable, and those individuals should be held responsible \nand held accountable.  But I also said that any reform measures we --  \nwe are looking at must look at the entire system and all the violence as \na whole that's going inside our correctional facilities because there is \nrising violence inside the correctional facilities.  And violence in any \nform is unacceptable and shouldn't be condoned and acceptable.  \nCertainly what -- if it's a corrections officer on an incarcerated \nindividual, an incarcerated individual on a corrections officer, or an \nincarcerated individual on an incarcerated individual, violence is \nprevalent inside our correctional facilities, unfortunately.  We've \ntalked about, it I'll say it again.  The HALT has caused problems and \nwe've seen dramatic rise in the violence since three years of its \nimplementation.  Incarcerated individual on staff assaults are up 76 \npercent over the three years since this implementation.  Incarcerated \nindividual on incarcerated individual is up over 169 percent to a \nrecord high of nearly 3,000 assaults.  Contraband seizures are up over \n32 percent during this time period, from 3,500 to 4,700.  And we \nknow drugs create violence and untenable situations inside our \ncorrectional facilities.  We've heard about the exposures that are \nhappening to people time and time again.  This is something -- and it's \nlike a dangerous powder keg envir -- inside our correctional facilities.  \nThis is something I, and I think many of my colleagues, would have \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n185liked to seen addressed more holistically, but I know that's something \nwe're gonna continue to deal with.  Because this is one of the issues \nthat was the main reasons [sic] for the protests or strikes, whatever \nword you want to use, we saw when we went with the corrections \nofficers not working.  It was about their safety and quality of life.  And \nwe still have a staffing crisis.  And to keep in mind, you know, the \nstaffing crisis, we -- there are programs that they want -- we want to \nput in place for incarcerated individuals.  If you don't have the staff to \nprovide those programs, then they're -- they're not gonna benefit from \nthose programs.  So we have to do a better job of staffing and just -- \nand recruitment and retention.  And there are much -- many other \nthings we could do from there; from whether it's the death gamble, \nlooking at the pay structure, the benefits, all those things.  Because if \nwe have good staff in there, that's gonna be able to help our \nincarcerated individuals rehabilitate and be better and be able to get \nout.  \nThe State Commission on Correctional's [sic] \nexpansion -- and I know I brought this up during our discussion -- I \njust believe, and many of us believe, not having a Minority \nappointment on this committee [sic] -- I mean, we've seen some little \nthings come through.  But things like -- and I talk about energy policy.  \nIf we didn't have certain people on the Climate Action Council, it \nwould have been -- would have been a disaster.  Big policies.  We \nshould have a voice at the table.  It's good to have difference and \ndiverse voices to have a discussion to come to a consensus.  But our \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n186voice is kind of left on the side and I think that's unfortunate.  And I \nalso think that we should also look at those people that get appointed, \nI think we should look at corrections officers because they bring a \nunique experience.  They've seen it all.  They understand the \nchallenges, they understand the opportunities.  And that would be \nsomething that could bring some value to that Commission on \nCorrections [sic].  And I think, again, to have that different broad view \nof opinions is something that would be really helpful.  I mean, I think \nthere's some questions, obviously, about the statute of limitations.  \nYou know, the questions we ask now, okay, will it just be on -- the \nsuit go against the State or could it come back and fall on an actual \ncorrections officer or a staff member in the future?  That's something I \nwould have concern about, and for how long and when's the end date.  \nThe -- the body cameras, we need to make sure there's proper training, \nequipment and material are -- are properly checked.  That there are \nclear guidelines on use, and absolutely at the end of the day, to make \nsure there's accountability.  And no doubt, reform was needed.  \nThere are some good things in this bill, and we \nunderstand the genesis behind the bill.  And I know my colleague \nworked really hard on this bill, and I know others worked really hard \non this bill.  And I can respect that.  But I think because of the things \nthat were not included, that were left out, things that we talked about \nand we will continue to talk about in this House, the impact of what's \ngoing on, you know, especially with our staff inside our correctional \nfacilities.  The overall environment, the powder keg environment \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n187that's been created, the -- the violence that's going on and the prison \nclosures, the staffing to the assaults, the drugs.  We need to do better.  \nWe need to look at this more holistically.  We need to help our \ncorrections officers with their recruitment and retention.  You know, \none such issue we talked about that passed in this House two years in \na row that the Governor vetoed two years in a row, said it should be \npart of the budget, is death gamble.  And we've had two bills that \npassed the House this -- earlier this week; one for counties and one for \njudges.  Why are we not providing that security to those corrections \nofficers and their families?  And this is something not only that they \nearned or deserve, but they earned it.  So we should protect that \npension for those corrections officers.  That will help retain \ncorrections officers at a time when we need more of them.  That will \nalso help to recruit more officers when they see that benefit.  So \nthere's much more we can do.  Although I understand the intentions \nbehind this bill, there are some good things in it, it's because of the \nthings that aren't addressed and my concerns and some others, I will \nbe voting in the negative on this piece of legislation. \nThank you, Madam Speaker and my colleagues. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Gibbs. \nMR. GIBBS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. GIBBS:  Madam Speaker, I want to start off by \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n188apologizing to my colleagues; Member Walsh and others.  But I want \nto explain to them also that the word \"inmate\" is very degrading.  And \nas the only member here with lived experiences, I can tell you how \ndehumanizing it is.  Palmesano and I, we had several conversations \nregarding this word and he's gotten better.  In fact, he hasn't said \n\"inmate\" in months because he understood that the word is degrading.  \nSo I apologize for getting emotion -- emotional when you say those \nwords because it takes me back to being inside the prisons.  And often \nthe corrections officers would use it to dehumanize us.  So hearing it \ncome out of the people [sic] mouths that I really respect, and in fact, \nDiapetro [sic] prayed for me right before the debate started and then \nwent on and said \"inmate\" three times.  Member Ari said the word \n\"inmate\" two times.  And when he came over here I just asked him, \nSir -- \nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, point of order.  We \nshould not be using the other members' names in -- in the comments \nthat are being made by --\nMR. GIBBS:  I -- I apologize.\nMS. WALSH:  -- the member who is speaking.  \nThank you. \nMR. GIBBS:  I apologize.  I'll get better, Member \nWalsh, I promise you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  Mr. \nGibbs, if you could just leave your comments without names of \ncolleagues, please. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n189MR. GIBBS:  Okay.  So when the other members say \nthe word \"inmate\" it's degrading.  Especially those who I look up to \nand respect wholeheartedly.  I also agree with 95.7 percent of the \nthings Palmesano said just now.  I know it's unbelievable, but I agree \nwith him most of the time.  \nWhen I was appointed to the Assembly Committee \non Correction, it seemed monumental.  As the first formerly- \nincarcerated State legislature [sic], I will have a seat at the table of the \nCommittee that determines the future of our prison system.  \nIn December when we all viewed the horrible and \nhorrific video of Robert Brooks beaten to death by prison guards at \nMarcy Correctional Facility while other staff and nurses looked on \nlaughing, I imagined we were facing a reckoning; one that would \nrequire this State legislative Body to ask the question, for whom do \nwe grant humanity?  For whom do we say your life is worthy of \nprotection?  \nDuring this important debate I've heard members \ndiscuss it's how important that correction officers be safe.  And I \nagree.  But DOCCS do [sic] not have a functioning system of \ndiscipline for corrections staff.  At a recent Correction hearing, \nCommissioner Martuscello agreed that I am not safe alone inside any \nNew York State correctional facility.  During conference recently, \nChairman Erik Dilan concluded that I am not safe inside any New \nYork State correctional facility alone.  In fact, I am more safe with the \nincarcerated individuals, but not so with the correction officers.  If a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n190sitting New York State legislature [sic] is unsafe in these New York \nState prison facilities, what do you think the incarcerated individuals \nare?  They're not safe either.  Ever since the modern-day lynching and \nmurder of Robert Brooks, I've been under attack.  I shared it with a \nfew members on that side.  NYSCOPBA  released the footage of me \ndisagreeing with an abusive sergeant, and they edit this footage and \nput it out into the universe.  The night I slept at the facility and me and \nthis young lady got into a debate about whether or not I should be \nthere.  As a result of that footage of being released, I received life- \nthreatening notes left on my vehicles five times at five different \nfacilities.  Edward, don't come back here.  You'll die.  Edward, you \nwhy you coming into these facilities?  And, in fact, at Coxsackie my \ntire was slashed.  And our New York State Trooper told me I have to \ndo this on my own.  Two weeks later, I go to Marcy, come out and \nmysteriously there's a nail in my back tire.  My gas tank was \n(indiscernible) and tampered with several times.  Several incidents of \nroad rage, most recently two weeks ago.  A colleague on my side was \ndriving back to Harlem with me.  Two corrections officers in pickup \ntrucks cutting us off and giving us the finger for 15 miles.  Thank God \nfor the State Trooper behind him.  He pulled us over, starts an \ninvestigation.  All because I spoke out on a Black man being \nmurdered in prison.  We all seen the footage.  We all know about Sam \nthe next week, right across the street from Marcy.  We heard about the \nmurder of Freddie McCree [phonetic] down at Coxsackie.  \nAnd as a human being -- not a politician, a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n191peopletician -- a person who love [sic] and respect all humans, White, \nBlack, whatever, yellow, I respect and love you all.  So as a guy who \nreally love [sic] humans and felt that as a State Legislature [sic] I \nshould speak out on murders and abusers in prisons.  Now I'm \nattacked.  And some of my friends on the other aisles who I thought \nwere really close to me used the \"inmate\" word loosely to trigger me.  \nI thought this Body was a Body that solved problems.  And joining the \nCorrection Committee, I was honored because I was willing to share \nmy story and my experiences.  Eighteen years old, sent to a maximum \nfacility in Elmira, men amongst men.  Eight months later I'm \ntransferred to Cayuga Community.  I'm hired as a GED rep.  And a \nyoung lady across the street from the program where I'm at -- \nPalmesano -- excuse me, member -- liked the fact that I was teaching \nformerly-incarcerated individuals how to get they [sic] GED.  And as \na result she wrote me a letter and sent me two mock necks and said \nthank you for helping these individuals.  Corrections found out about \nit.  They fired the civilian and they transferred me.  Though I had no \nhistory of talking to this young lady, I never responded.  Never even \nsaid hi to her.  But they transferred me and they transferred me to \nMid-State where there was a welcoming party.  Five officers waiting.  \nHow dare you talk to a White woman in prison?  Now, I could share \nthe abuse.  I could share the 25 minutes of beating.  I could share the \nten minutes of stepping on my head and ankles and everything else.  \nI've shared that with many on the other side already.  And I thought \nthat I garnered enough respect that you guys wouldn't even use that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n192word around me anymore.  I share with most of you over there than I \nshare with my colleagues over here.  Most of you over there know \nabout the threats.  You know about the windows and the letters left on \nmy windshield.  In fact, Commissioner Martuscello talked with five of \nus about that.  Diapetro [sic] being one of them.  So I'm human.  To \nhuman is to be err, to err to be human, however you professionals say \nit.  I have emotions.  I love people.  All people.  Be you know that.  \nAnd all I ask is for the same amount of respect that I give you.  I don't \nknow if I can say \"cracker\" in this Chamber, I don't want to be written \nup.  I'm not gonna say that.  But those terms don't come to my mind \nwhen I see you guys.  I see humans.  And all I ask is for that same \namount of respect.   \nNow, back to this package.  Though I believe this \npackage is heading in the right direction, it's simply not enough.  \nWhen a member of the Correction Committee, Wayne Jackson here in \nthe New York State Assembly is not safe to go inside of a prison -- \nfour minutes?  Thank you.  It's a problem.  And I shared with most of \nyou guys that I'm threatened and tires are slashed and stabbed, running \nme and Jordan off the road.  I don't feel supported.  I don't feel the \nlove from my colleague [sic].  I don't feel the love from the Chamber.  \nI don't feel the love from my Conference or the Committee.  Not the \nsame love I give each and every one of you.  I give you all authentic, \nopen Eddie Gibbs.  That's all I ask for in return. \nSo this package, it's a good package.  It really is.  But \nit's simply isn't enough.  Not enough to address the years of abuse and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n193murder.  Most that was swept under the rug because we didn't have \ncameras then.  I encourage each and every one of you go to a prison \nand visit.  Talk to correction officers and talk to incarcerated \nindividuals.  Stop legislating blindly.  And you'll see the real story.  \nAll I want to is do what is right.  My community elected me here to do \nwhat's right, and I did that, Your Honor.  And I'm attacked.  That's \nwhere my emotion and anger comes from.  Worry about getting in \nyour car.  Worrying about going to a prison, are you gonna come out \nsafe?  Are they gonna put stuff on you?  Are they gonna accuse you \nagain?  All I'm trying to do is what's right.  And I spoke out on \n(indiscernible) injustice.  And now I got a whole union attacking little \nold me.  Can't even drive down I-87 no more.  Get my car checked for \ntrackers because I can't figure out how they find me.  All because I \nspoke out against a murder in prison.  So I expected this package to be \na little bit more.  I expected my colleagues to be more understanding.  \nAnd maybe I just don't share enough. \nSo as a result I'm a negative on this package.  But I \nbelieve that we are heading in the right direction.  Three men were \nkilled and nobody bat [sic] an eye.  Nobody.  I'm in a Chamber full of \nprofessionals, and I ain't seen one tear.  So again, Member Walsh and \nmy fellow colleagues, I apologize for that and I hope you guys truly \nunderstand that that word is hurtful, very hurtful.  I apologize.  Very \nhurtful to me.  And you know I would never disrespect any of you \nguys over there.  And for a member to invite me outside because I \nasked him not to use that word anymore --  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n194ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nGibbs.  \nMR. GIBBS:  -- it's discouraging. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Beephan.\nMR. BEEPHAN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields, \nMR. BEEPHAN:  I figured you got a good 15 minute \nbreak there.\nMR. DILAN:  Well, I think the -- I think the message \nwas important to hear. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  I agree.\nMR. DILAN:  But I will say that my position on the \nfloor here puts me kind of at a disadvantage as it relates to these \ndebates.  Very important message to hear.  \nMR. BEEPHAN:  No worries, no worries at all.  So, \ncan we discuss the changes regarding CANY in this legislation?  \nMR. DILAN:  Certainly.  \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Would you like to give a brief \noverview of what's changed in the legislation?  Or --  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  So, I guess to -- a -- a brief \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n195overview, right, would -- the bill will make several changes to expand \nthe authority of CANY, including allowing notice -- including more \nnotice like right now, even if there's a lockdown, if there's an \nemergency-wide lockdown, CANY can operate.  This will address \nsome of CANY's ability to operate during a lockdown, DOCCS \ncertainly retains, you know, some -- some emergency protocol.  They \ndo retain that, but it doesn't automatically prohibit a CANY visit. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Has CANY reported that they have \ndifficulty accessing facilities right now?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I guess -- I --\n(Conferencing)\nSo, yes.  So, I guess the issue is not necessarily \nCANY being inside during a lockdown.  Currently, it's the amount of \nnotice that CANY is required to provide DOCS. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Because right now it's 72 hours, \nbut it seems (cross-talk/indiscernible) to 24.  \nMR. DILAN:  This would change it to 24, yes.  \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  And say, you know, the  \nfacilities are, you know, many of them are currently understaffed by \nthousands of employees.  Weekend staffing is sometimes even smaller \nor less than their -- their required amount or amount they'd like.  So, \nsay on a Friday, they call and they say they're going to be visiting \nSaturday afternoon.  Is that jail now required to make staffing changes \nto the account for CANY coming there?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I mean, there -- there's --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n196(Conferencing)\nSo, there -- there's never been a difficulty in the past \nas it relates to CANY staff -- staffing.  I guess under -- under the \nshortened window, you know, CANY is not -- while they have \nauthority under the legislation provided back in the 1800s that I \ndiscussed about earlier, they still have a 72 hour notice.  So, this gives \nDOCCS -- any  DOCCS facility up to three days to prepare for -- \nMR. BEEPHAN:  No, they're -- you're reducing it to \n24,  I believe.\nMR. DILAN:  I spoke wrong.  Yeah, of course we're \nreducing to 24.  Currently laws -- currently, it's 72. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Well, I figured with 72 hours -- \nbecause CANY as it stands right now, they can't be in that facility \nwithout an escort, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  That is correct -- correct.  \nMR. BEEPHAN:  So, my thought process is 24 hours \nof noticed, especially when we're already suffering with staffing -- a \nstaffing crisis, you know, are we going to be mandating COs to stay \novertime to be there when CANY's there, walking the facilities, \nmeeting with incarcerated individuals?  \nMR. DILAN:  I don't -- I don't know that we'd be  \nmandating overtime, but I also don't see a situation in where it would \nbe a burden on the facility.  So, I -- to provide color, I last summer did \na visit with CANY and we -- we were, at that point, supervised.  I \nthink the difference between me and CANY is that, certainly, one, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n197CANY is much more prepared and professional and know the right -- \nknows the right questions and the things to look for, as it relates to \nwhat they are looking for in deficiencies or potential problems in the \nfacility.  But what they don't have is something that every State \nlegislator has, is the pop-up authority to go visit a facility.  They have \nto provide, under current law, 72 hours notice --\nMR. BEEPHAN:  Right.\nMR. DILAN:  So, that could potentially -- not that \nthree days is enough to -- to hide anything that they may be concerned \nthat may come out in the CANY report and it -- it may potentially \nprovide them a way to, I guess, address the staffing issues.  On my \nvisit, the -- the -- the staffing requirements on what we did was \n(indiscernible) one of two individuals.  \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Now, I see this also limits the \nCommissioner's authority to restrict their access during emergencies \nand lockdowns.  Is there any situation where he will continue to be \nable to restrict it?  You know, especially under extenuating \ncircumstances?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  So, under emergency situations, \nthey would be limited to the administrative offices. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  So, they will still get access \ninside the facility, just to the administrative offices. \nMR. DILAN:  Correct. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  Would you describe CANY \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n198to be more of an incarcerated individual advocacy group?  \nMR. DILAN:  No, and I -- I -- I think that's unfair to \nclassify them that.  I mean, you know, clearly that's why I thought it \nwas important to establish when CANY was founded.  CANY, like I \nsaid earlier, was founded in -- in the 1800s because citizens were \nconcerned about what was going on in prisons.  And on my visit, you \nknow, they certainly did a thorough job in interviewing incarcerated \nindividuals on their conditions.  I spoke to them privately, you know, \nso, privately there was, you know, certainly DOCCS staff there.  But \nthey were away.  They were able to have one-on-one conversations \nthat the -- the DOCCS staff was not privy to, but what I would say is \nthey spent an equal amount of time talking with the management at \nevery facility.  They spent a good amount of time speaking to the \nheads of each of the unions at the facility and, you know, they also \nasked them questions about concerns and conditions that they are \nunder as well.  And, you know, I think it was beneficial to me to do \nthat visit with them last -- last summer, because I got to -- one, it \nimproved myself as a -- a legislator, but two, I got to really appreciate \nhow thorough they are in their jobs and how independent they are and \nthat they do truly speak to all sides. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Do -- do they often in their reports \ndiscuss issues facing corrections officers?  Like staffing, mandatory \novertime, assaults on corrections officers?  \nMR. DILAN:  They -- they -- they do do that, yes.\nMR. BEEPHAN:  They do?  I -- I just find it \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n199interesting that now they get two appointees to the commission in this \nbill, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  They do.\nMR. BEEPHAN:  And, you know, from my \nperspective, I see them oftentimes as advocates for the incarcerated \nindividuals.  You know, it would've been, you know, a bit more of a \nfair situation than say with NYSCOPBA  or also able to appoint a \nperson, or two, to this commission, in -- you know, in addition to the \nGovernor, the Speaker, the Senate.  But I guess we'll move on from \nthat topic. \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, and I -- I would just say my \nopinion in CANY and I know there was -- there's a certain perception, \nbecause I -- I -- I might have shared it before my visit, but upon \nconducting a visit with them and seeing how they conduct at work, I -- \nI would say they're the most balanced, nonpartisan entity in this bill. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Now moving onto video \ndisclosure.  So I see now that they have 72 hours to turn over any \nvideo footage relevant to a death to the AG's office, correct?  That's \nbody cams, facility footage, fixed cameras, all that?\nMR. DILAN:  That's correct.  To the AG's OSI.  \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  So that's like an internal \ncommunication between DOCCS and the AG.  No formal request \nneeded, nothing like that?  \nMR. DILAN:  No.  It's mandatory they have \n(indiscernible).\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n200MR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  Now, were there any \ndiscussions of perhaps using the same 72 hour time frame to allow for \ncorrections officers or other entities to request video footage when say \nthey were assaulted by an incarcerated individual?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, I guess -- \n(Conferencing)\nI guess the concern is -- the reason why the AG's unit \nof the OSI was created, it didn't only include corrections officers at the \ntime, it also include members of the police force.  It -- it was intended \nto -- that whole unit was intended to investigate deaths when they \nwere occurred by police or peace officers.  So, it's -- it's -- it's geared \nthat way so that, you know, the -- the -- the counties across the State, \nregardless, are -- are taking it out.  And if we're going into other \nsections of -- of the current law, not the bill now, but just for -- for \ncolor, you know, it's certainly geared that way so that the familiarity \nthat -- and the work -- and the strong working relationships that \ncounty DAs and county police forces have, it was done that way to, \nagain, remove any appearance of unfamiliarity, or -- or conflicts, or \nworking relationships so that the true facts of the matter all other \ndeaths done by a peace officer could be investigated independently by \nthe AG's office.\nMR. BEEPHAN:  Yeah.  I understand -- \nMR. DILAN:  So, this -- so, this would -- continue \nthat. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Yeah.  No, of course.  But, I -- I'm \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n201just saying that now there's going to be a process in place where, you \nknow, DOCCS could come up with that footage within 72 hours and \nturn it over to the AG, why can't they also be able to come up with \nfootage within 72 hours and give it to one of their own employees?  \nMR. DILAN:  Because that's an issue for -- for \nDOCCS to address and certainly in legislation wasn't really needed for \nDOCCS to -- to deal with things that are -- that are in their possession \nand -- and do things within their own agency. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Does this bill expand the use of \nbody cams for corrections officers?  \nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  Does it address a body cam \npolicy in any way?\nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  Got it.  So, I know that, you \nknow, in the budget we covered it and, you know, we've discussed this \nat our hearings with the -- the Commissioner.  You know, not that \nlong ago, corrections officers were forced to wear their body cams in \nbathroom.  So, I hope that, you know, as these discussions, you know, \ncarry on, we kind of address those concerns whether it's \nadministratively or here legislatively.  As we expand the use of \ncameras, we keep a focus on privacy and making sure our own \nemployees aren't being violated in any way. \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  So, I would -- I would say to \nthat, that, you know, obviously that's a concern.  We -- we're looking \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n202for the relevant facts of any potential -- of potential situation that may \narise inside a facility.  Certainly, you know, areas of privacy like you \nmentioned, I'm glad they corrected and even in the instances where we \nare expanding authority, we do make references to a, you know, place \nwhere folks are entitled to privacy.\nMR. BEEPHAN:  When -- when coming up with this \nomnibus bill, did -- were any proposals made to address the staffing \nsituation?  Specifically regarding the -- the employees that were fired \npost strike?  \nMR. DILAN:  So, I don't know that there -- there are \nany -- \n(Conferencing)\nYeah.  So, it -- it -- it -- it's certainly out of the scope, \nbut I would say that discussions on recruiting to addresses the -- the \nstaffing crisis has, you know, come up not -- not only in your \nconference, but in mine as well.  We all recognize that there is a -- a \ncrisis and we recognize how hard it is to gain and -- and retain \ncorrections officers.  Some of those we've addressed in -- in the \nbudget by actions we've taken in -- in the budget.  So while this \npackage doesn't address that, folks recognize that it is a legitimate \nissue. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Got it.  Does this omnibus bill \naddress visitation at all?  \nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Okay.  All right. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n203I guess I will go on the bill.  Thank you.  \nMR. DILAN: Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. BEEPHAN:  Well, I can tell you that I want to \nstart with saying I truly am sorry for the family of Mr. Brooks and the \nothers impacted by what's happened in our facilities.  I -- I completely \nagree change needs to happen within our correctional facilities.  I \nthink this omnibus is a start in many ways, whether I agree or disagree \nwith some components of it.  But I don't believe it goes far enough.  I \nbelieve that we have not addressed the root cause of this bill.  Whether \nit's some of the provisions at HALT, to the staffing crisis, to \naddressing drugs within the facilities and exposures that both \nincarcerated individuals and our corrections officers face each and \nevery single day.  And it also doesn't address the -- the overall need \nfor an expanded recruitment process and retention process that I think \nwould tremendously change the environment within each of our \nprisons.  For that I'm gonna have to heavily consider how I'm gonna \nvote on this bill, but I thank the sponsor for his time. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nBeephan.\nMs. Cruz.  \nMS. CRUZ:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for a quick couple of questions?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n204MR. DILAN:  Certainly.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMS. CRUZ:  Mr. Chairman, does this bill change the \npublic's access to the actual video footage if there is a -- a death or a \nmurder inside one of our prison systems?  \nMR. DILAN:  No.\nMS. CRUZ:  Who retains power to make a \ndetermination of what is relevant parts of the video or make any \nredactions to the video?  \nMR. DILAN:  The AG's OSI unit.\nMS. CRUZ:  Thank you.  And does this bill change \nanything else other than the actual statute of limitations in the process \nof someone filing a lawsuit?  For example, would it change the type of \nevidence, where to file, when it file?  \nMR. DILAN:  Nothing.  It simply just gives them \nthree more years.\nMS. CRUZ:  Thank you.  \nOn -- on the bill, Madam Speaker.  Thank you, Mr. \nChairman. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMS. CRUZ:  Before I start, I want to address \neveryone on a personal and professional level.  We are entitled to our \nviews, to our religious and political beliefs.  What we cannot do is \ncarry on in this House with carelessness and even sometimes \npurposeful use of words that do not belong on this floor.  Words \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n205matter.  We owe it to each other to have respect.  If a colleague tells \nus whether it's in here or outside that the word you are using is \ndehumanizing, have enough decency and respect for your colleague \nnot to use it.  You can't get -- you can get your point across without \ndehumanizing someone and that once a debate is over, you're gonna \ncome out of here and act like they're your friend or your colleague.  \nHave some respect and decency for your colleagues.\nI want to thank the Speaker for this package and our \ncolleagues who led the fight and our Corrections Chairman for \ncarrying it, but I especially want to thank my friend and colleague, \nEddie Gibbs, for channeling his lived experience and trauma to help \nus make real change.  This is a starting line, not the finish line.  There \nare a significant number of bills that did not make it into this package \nthat must be considered next year, including Second Look Act, the \nEarned Time Act, Fair and Timely Parole and Elder Parole Acts.  The \nmurder and violence against incarcerated people in our State is an \nepidemic and we must address the underlying reasons why it has \nhappened.  Address roadblocks and investigate when it happens and \npunish in order to deter this horrific behavior.  \n In 1976, the State began tracking the deaths of \nincarcerated individuals while in custody.  The numbers are quite \nhorrifying, but truthfully, not shocking.  7,504 have died while under \nthe custody of DOCCS.  This is seven times more than the number of \npeople that we executed in the State when it used to be legal.  This \nincludes individuals like Layleen Polanco, Mr. Robert Brooks and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n206Messiah -- Messiah Nantwi and many others who were murdered by \nstaff.  But this is not just a murder of -- murder victims, there are \nhundreds and possibly thousands of individuals who've been \nphysically and sexually assaulted while in our prison system and our \njail system.  An astonishing 719 sexual assault lawsuits have been \nfiled against the Department of Correction by formerly incarcerated \nwomen, alleging a pattern of abuse that goes back decades.  We have \na duty to them, to their families, to all incarcerated individuals to put \nthe legal tools in place to begin real change.  The bill today includes \ntwo key legislative proposals.  One ensures the video footage is turned \nover to the Attorney General's Office swiftly to ensure a thorough \ninvestigation and the subsequent prosecution can be done when \nsomeone has died in custody and staff is involved.  And the second \nensures that when the statute of limitations is told to ensure that \nsurvivors can seek justice when they have been physically or sexually \nabused by staff.  When incarcerated people die under suspicious  \ncircumstances, it is critical that an independent investigator have full \naccess to the video and immediately and without interference.  Right \nnow correctional facilities control the very evidence that might \nimplicate them and their own officers.  This creates an inherent \nconflict of interest and invites for cover- ups.  Even in high profile \ndeaths, families and (indiscernible) bodies have waited months or \nmaybe never even received them.  This bill ends that by routing \nfootage directly to OSI; a neutral and independent entity created to \ninvestigate the deaths in custody.  We improve accountability without \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n207compromising legal procedures.  Officers who acted appropriately \nshould want this footage reviewed.  It exonerates them and the -- and \nidentifies systematic failures, not just individual wrongdoing.  The bill \nupholds New York's values around government accountability in \nincarceration and ensuring all lives, including those behind bars, are \ntreated with dignity.  This bill also creates an avenue for individuals \nwho have a claim arise while in custody to bring a suit by tolling the \ncivil statute of limitations until the individual is no longer in custody \nand can feel safe to come forward and seek an attorney.  The bill \nremoves unfair legal hurdles, keeping survivors abused in the -- our \nState custody from accessing the justice they deserve and provides \ndeterrence to prevent new abuse from occurring.  While the bill idea \ncomes from work we've done with women who were sexually \nassaulted in prison by their correction officers, or other staff.  From \nLGBTQ individuals who are physically and sexually assaulted due to \nnegligent supervision while in custody, it will help any incarcerated \nindividual who was abused while in custody.  \nWe've heard the reality lived by victims who are \nincarcerated.  They face retaliation in a variety of forms, including  \nfurther physical and sexual and emotional abuse, having legal papers \ndestroyed, had mail and packages destroyed, faced delays in seeing \ntheir legal counsel, verbal abuse and so on and so on.  We know that it \nis incredibly difficult for a person to come forward and that person is \nnot incarcerated.  Add to that being in the care -- in the care of a \nsystem that is allowing further abuse to continue.  This bill is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n208necessary to provide adequate access to justice once a person's out.  \nFurther, we know that many justice involved \nindividuals are not informed about the Notice of Claim requirement \nand are unaware that they have just 90 days to file in order to pursue a \nfuture civil claim.  And I suspect that many of us didn't -- didn't know \nthat that was a requirement as well. \n Lastly, but importantly, I want to recognize the \nfamilies of those murdered while in custody.  The survivors who have \nfought for change, we are beginning today.  I know I speak for many \nof us here today, we are sorry for your loss.  We are sorry for the \nabuse you have suffered.  We hope this will begin a path to justice and \nhealing and we are comitted to continuing to fight for real change.  \nAnd I know he had stepped out, so I do want to say thank you to my \nfriend Eddie for teaching me and for teaching many of us what real \ncourage looks like.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMs. Gallagher.  \nMS.

DILAN:  Well, I think it -- it -- it's important \nbecause CANY obviously is, you know, an independent oversight \nBody as prescribed by laws back -- way back when I said earlier.  \nThey conduct these visits, they give reports on potential conditions to \nus publicly as charged by law and so is the State Commission on \nCorrections.  So, I think it's vitally important that the two independent \noversight entities that we have in this State, one set forth by charter, \none set forth by legislation, actually get together in an official form \nand communicate with each other.  So, this particularly doesn't say a \nmember of CANY has to serve on that board, but they can appoint \nsomeone to be their liaison.  It doesn't prohibit them from appointing  \none of their members on the board either, but I think it was important \nso that the two independent bodies have a more connected \nprofessional relationship.  This will do that formally, and I also think \nwe need to do more to strengthen the operations of the State \nCommission on Corrections, even though it's not directly related to \nyour question.  We -- we -- we gave them more funding in the budget, \nbut they were charged to do as a government entity, similar to what \nCANY was charged to do as a non-government entity.  So, the fact \nthat they are talking and working together is vital. \nMS. GALLAGHER:  Thank you so much.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. GALLAGHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nI'm proud to vote for this omnibus bill, which includes two of my \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n210original bills; the SCOC Reform Bill and the Terry Cooper Autopsy \nAccountability Act.  We all began this Session with the image of Mr. \nRobert Brooks' lynching burned into our minds.  The way he was \nbeaten with his hands cuffed behind his back while at least 14 \ncorrections staff eagerly participated, or casually watched, spoke to an \nengrained culture of violence and impunity.  For me and for many of \nmy colleagues, his murder lit a fire under us to increase oversight and \naccountability to protect our incarcerated community members.  This \nbill will deliver that and it will save lives.  \nBriefly, just a bit about my two bills that are included \nin the omnibus.  The SCOC Reform Bill has been a labor of love and \npassion.  My office wrote it after I visited Rikers Island in 2021 and \nwitnessed the utterly inhumane and degrading conditions people are \nsubject to.  The experience lead me to a question:  Who is statutorily \nresponsible for providing oversight in our jails and prisons?  The \nanswer is, the State Commission on Correction [sic].  This bill will \nexpand and diversify the SCOC, so it can once again be a robust body \nwith the people and resources necessary to protect incarcerated \npeople.  With us today are advocates from the Katal Center and they, \nalong with the Jails Justice Network, have been fighting alongside me \nfor the bill for years.  This year, Mr. Brooks' father, Mr. Robert Ricks, \nalso played a crucial role in fighting for these life-saving bills.  Thank \nyou all for your work, this is your victory today. \nThe Terry Cooper Autopsy Accountability Act was \nnamed after Terry Cooper, a husband and father, who was beaten by \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n211officers using batons.  He was beaten so badly that he died.  They tried \nto pass his death off as a natural cause, because the beating triggered \nan asthma attack.  His autopsy report did not include photographs that \nhad been taken of Mr. Cooper after he passed away, which clearly \nshowed that he had been beaten with batons.  The photographs were \nultimately discovered years after his death when his family filed a \nlawsuit, which they won.  This bill would require autopsy reports to \ninclude all photographs of the body, slides and post-mortem X-rays \nwhen someone dies, or is killed in State custody.  As we've seen with \nthe murders of Mr. Brooks, Mr. Nantwi and Mr. Cooper, we cannot \ncount on corrections officers being forthcoming about the cause of \ndeath when someone dies or is killed in State custody.  The Terry \nCooper Autopsy Accountability Act will ensure that everyone who is \nincarcerated is afforded the basic dignity and transparency that \neveryone deserves, particularly when they die on our watch.  Thank \nyou to Mr. Cooper's family, Dave Rankin and Joshua Moskovitz, Mr. \nCooper's lawyers and the lawyers who fought for justice in their \nlandmark case.  \nThese two bills and the package as a whole will \nincrease oversight and provide an essential layer of protection, \naccountability and transparency.  It is not enough and it is certainly \njust the first step.  There's a crisis in our prisons and jails and \noversight alone won't solve it.  We must enure that HALT is fully \nimplemented and that programming is restored and expanded so \npeople are able to rehabilitate themselves while inside.  We must fight \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n212for sentencing and parole reform to address mass incarceration and \nensure that people who have been rehabilitated can be released and \nrejoin their communities and their families.  I also urge my colleagues \nto personally visit prisons and jails alongside CANY.  It has changed \nmy life and been extremely informative about the failures of our State \nand what we must do to correct them.  I am dedicated to continue \nvisiting and I want to change it.  This bill is an essential first step if we \nare to meaningfully move the needle for our incarcerated community \nmembers.  It will save lives and begin to change the culture of \nviolence and impunity in our prisons and jails.  I want to thank \nSpeaker Heastie and Chair Dilan for their work on this package \ntogether and thank you for including these two very personal pieces of \nlegislation.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Gandolfo. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor please yield for a couple of questions? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. DILAN:  Certainly, and --\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. DILAN:  --and as we -- we -- Phil, I forgot to \nsay -- excuse me, as with the previous member, this is the first time \nwe get to do this and -- \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Yeah.  I'm very excited about \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n213this.  But a lot of my questions have been asked and answered already, \nbut I have a couple of things I do want to clarify.  First, on the topic of \nvideo surveillance.  This requires the installation and maintenance of \ncameras throughout the facilities.  I was wondering if you could speak \na little bit about the current state of cameras at the State facilities; are \n-- if there's certain facilities where this is a particular problem?  Are \nmost already maintaining these cameras?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  No, I -- yeah.  So, certainly we \nput a lot of money in the -- the budget on it.  There are some facilities \nthat do have the cameras, but to speak to the specific ones that have \nproblems or don't have problems, I don't know that I'm prepared to \ngive you that answer at this time.  But I know that the DOCCS \ncommissioner is certainly aware of that and which ones and is \nworking on it. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Thank you for that \nanswer.  And -- now, the superintendents and wardens are responsible \nfor the assessment and making sure everything's up.  Is there a certain, \nI guess, time frame if they discover any kind of malfunction or lapse \nin coverage if they have to get this back up and running?  Or is this \njust you see it, you fix it as soon as reasonably possible?  \nMR. DILAN:  It would be the latter part. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay, thank you.  And this \nrequires the footage to be stored for a minimum of a year, my \ncolleague touched on that earlier.  Is that only the physical, I guess, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n214stationary security cameras, or does that also include the body camera \nfootage?  \nMR. DILAN:  So fixed or stationary, no body \ncameras.  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So, body cameras -- is \nthere a length of time -- I know we did that in the budget, so it's \nprobably not in this bill, is there a length of time that the body camera \nfootage has to be stored?  \nMR. DILAN:  My gut says yes, but we have to get \nback to you on that.  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  All right, thank you.  \nNow, and I know the -- there -- there's a sensitive areas provision here \nwhere cameras can't be placed: showers, bathrooms, inside the cell.  \nCould -- is it your estimation that maybe if there's a camera outside \none of those areas, not in those restricted areas, that it would still pick \nup audio possibly if there was an incident that happened?  \nMR. DILAN:  Po -- Potentially -- \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.\nMR. DILAN:  -- but I think the concern is about \nprivacy. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Right.  I was just curious if like \nin case there was an incident in one of those areas, what -- \nMR. DILAN:  Like if there's a fight or something like \nthat?\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Yeah, a fight.  Like --  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n215MR. DILAN: Um, I mean, sure.  Potentially.  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.\nMR. DILAN:  But, you know, for the most part, \nwhile people are doing the things that -- that -- that everybody does \nneeds privacy. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  We would like some privacy, I \nagree.  And I wanted to clarify a couple of things on -- in Part J, the \nlook-back period.  So, just briefly, let's say a -- the statute of \nlimitations on a personal injury claim is three years.  Say someone \nwanted to bring a claim from something that happened in prison, let's \nsay from ten years ago, but the statute of limitations would have run \nout on that claim.  Is this extra three years restarting that statute of \nlimitations?  So, if you were serving a 15 year sentence and something \nhappened in year two and now three years when you're released, could \nyou still bring a claim on that if the statute of limitations has \npreviously expired?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  Well, so, I -- I guess, to clarify, \nit's not a look-back provision.\nMR. GANDOLFO: Okay.\nMR. DILAN: So, if anything that has happened and \nno one has yet brought an action before this is effective, the new \npart -- the new proposal that we're addressing today won't be able to \ncover that part.  However, if enacted into law by the Governor, that \nwould be -- the second part of your question would be, that would be \nthe exact purpose of this, so that if this is enacted and someone chose \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n216their -- their safety, but maybe got out and got advice, they have three \nyears to commence that action post-release. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So -- just so I want to \nmake sure I understood your answer.  So, essentially, this could \npotentially, I guess, expand a statute of limitations, for lack of a better \nword here, what's in a personal injury case ten years if -- if this \nincident happened?  \nMR. DILAN:  Potentially.  \nMR. GANDOLFO: Okay.\nMR. DILAN: Potentially, but that is really not -- not \nthe goal.  I think we -- we don't want to penalize folks for choosing \nsafety, because if they make the determination while -- while they're \nincarcerated, that is just better for me not to say anything --\nMR. GANDOLFO: Right.\nMR. DILAN: -- because I fear for my safety.  \nCurrently, if they make that choice, the statute of limitations is \nrunning and there -- there's nothing that they can do about it. \nMR. GANDOLFO: Okay.\nMR. DILAN: Under this proposal, you know, they \ncan do that and they get three years post-release. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  I understand that.  And it \nalso mentions for psychological injuries.  Is that a new edition or is \nthat already the case?  This is just -- \nMR. DILAN:  No.  The only thing new are the -- the \nextra three years post-release. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n217MR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Okay.  And then one \nmore question on the autopsy reporting.  In the text I didn't see any \nmention of a toxicology report.  Perhaps because that might get sent to \na third-party lab after the blood is drawn.  Would a toxicology report \nhave to be included in the autopsy reporting requirement?\nMR. DILAN:  No.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Was that an intentional \nchoice or is there, I guess, a reason that wouldn't be included?  I didn't \nknow if it was just something that was overlooked. \nMR. DILAN:  So, it -- it -- it's not limiting --\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay. \nMR. DILAN:  -- if they -- if they chose to add it -- \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So, there -- there's \nnothing prohibit -- \nMR. DILAN:  There's nothing that prohibits them, \nbut the items that are prescribed in the bill are things that they would \nbe, you know, mandated to do.  Toxicology would not be one of those. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay, that's all I have.  Thank \nyou, Mr. Dilan.  \nMadam Speaker, on the bill, briefly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  You know, so far throughout this \ndebate, we kind of heard people from both sides -- approaching the \nbill from both sides, say that this did not go far enough.  So, it \nprobably does tell us this is right somewhere around where we need to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n218be, because there is some good stuff in this bill that I think are positive \nreforms.  I do have some concerns about cost, especially when you \nopen up -- you add on more years where someone can file a claim.  I \ndo think that might result in a situation where claims can get out of \ncontrol and really run the cost up to the State.  But, I -- again, I will \nreiterate, this is -- you can tell that the sponsor did put a lot of work \ninto this and I would like to commend him on that, regardless of \nwhere the votes fall today.  \nAnd one more thing I wanted to address, this was a \nlittle bit of a heated debate.  I did not find it appropriate to be lectured \nabout respecting colleagues in here.  There have been several times \nwhere members of our side of the aisle had to be lectured and have \nhad horrible insinuations made about our character during resolutions, \nno less, which are supposed to be nice, commemorative, meaningful \nthings and no one on our side stood up and interrupted, as to not make \na spectacle of what is meant to be a very meaningful statement as a  \nBody and oftentimes we agree with the statement being made.  So, \njust keep in mind that respect is a two-way street and it -- it would \nserve everyone well to remember that.\nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Weprin. \nMR. WEPRIN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n219MR. WEPRIN:  This omnibus bill contains a series of \nprison reforms to improve transparency and accountability in State \ncorrectional facilities following the recent death of two incarcerated \nmen who had violent encounters with multiple correction officers and \nI'm referring to Robert Brooks and Messiah Nantwi.  This much- \nneeded legislation includes provisions which I sponsored since my \ntime as Correction Chair, which I chaired for six years in this House.  \nSpecifically, Part H in this bill will amend Section 146 of the \nCorrection Law to allow the Correctional Association of New York to \nprovide 24 hour notice to visit a prison and have access to public \nrecords without having to submit Freedom of Information Law \nrequest.  The Correctional Association of New York, or CANY as it is \nreferred, was founded, as my colleagues have pointed out, in 1844.  \nThe Correctional Association of New York serves a unique and vital \nrole in shedding light on conditions within New York's prisons and in \nadvocating for reforms.  This legislation will enable CANY to im -- to \nproperly fulfill its unique role as a watchdog of the State's correctional \nsystem, thereby improving the safety, health and well-being of \nincarcerated individuals, as well as DOCCS staff.  \nI want to thank the sponsor, Mr. Dilan, for his hard \nwork, his dedication.  I also want to thank Speaker Heastie and this \nlegislative Body for upholding our commitment to criminal justice \nreform.  This is only a beginning, not an end what we need to build on \nthis package.  \nThank you, Madam Speaker.  I -- I proudly will vote \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n220in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Burroughs.\nMR. BURROUGHS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nOn the bill\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. BURROUGHS:  I have a great individual that I \nbelieve raised me and that is Mrs. Burroughs and because of that, I \nwould like to speak a quote that she often spoke to me.  She says, \n\"talk less, listen more and it'll allow you to hear the hearts of a man.\" \nNow, there's things that have been spoken here today and it allowed \nme to see the true heart of some of my colleagues.  A lot of things that \nhave transpired throughout today and throughout the rest of the \nSession, it allows me to just look at the individuals and see the true \ncare, concern, or maybe the hate that may be in the heart.  I've heard \nsome things today that have shown that people are truly bias and \nuncaring of people's situations.  So, many of the -- my colleagues on \nthe -- on the other aisle have that have spoken, I've heard them speak \nonly the concerns of the correction officers.  One time I heard them \nspeak about the incarcerated individuals.  That shows bias, because if \nI can think -- and we all have known, we've seen what has happened \nwith so many of the incarcerated individuals this year and let's get this \nright.  If there are individuals that are dying, or being murdered, to \nwho should call it, outside of our prisons, that should be addressed.  \nWe can't look at the person who is considered a victim and then ask \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n221the person who is the accuser, well, why did you do this?  Why did you \nhurt that individual?   Or, can we make it better for that person who \nhurt the individual?   That shows the bias and the uncaring nature \nwithin some of us.\nNow, last I recall, Robert Brooks -- aside from Robert \nBrooks, there were 75 other deaths or murders, whatever we want to \ncall it.  And we're still defending the individuals who are perpetrating \nthese acts.  That leads me to question some of us.  How were we \nraised?  Things that I do on a daily basis, there's always two people \npeople that I keep in mind and that is mom and my dad.  I always \nthink about the lessons that they taught me; about being a caring \nindividual.  Don't see color.  Don't see race.  And that's not what I'm \nseeing today.  I'm seeing a lot of people jaded by political acumen.  \nSo, I'm going to decide to do something because this is what my party \nsays I should do and I don't -- I don't think that's what we're here for.  \nNow, we're speaking of certain things that happen.  \nWhat's inside the prison systems?  Drugs and other things that are \nbeing loosely spread throughout the facilities.  But when you are \nentering an incarcerated facility, you don't have the things that the \nincarcerated individuals may have been found to have had in their \nlockers, or in their bunks, or in their beds.  Now, if you didn't have it \nwhen you went in, that means you didn't bring it in.  So it's getting in \nsome other way.  Now, I don't know, as Legislators, if you think.  Let's \nuse common sense.  If it wasn't in there in the beginning, how'd it \ncome in from some other way?  So, individuals defending, forget \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n222about any of the incarcerated individuals, but you're only defending \nDOCCS employees.  That says you're jaded.  That says your hearts in \nthe wrong place.  And I don't think this place is a place for someone \nwho is showing bias. \nNow some of these things that do enter into systems, \nthese things can be stopped.  There's body imaging and scanners.  If \nyou look at these, the options of the staff, the staff has the option of \nnot going through a body scanner.  That will tell you where these \nunwanted items are coming from.  And so maybe this bill is in the \nright direction -- is headed towards the right direction and we need to \n-- we need to discuss or actually pushing it forward to work harder \nbecause I don't think it does enough.  But it is a step in the right \ndirection.  \nNow, to take care of some of the issues that we have, \nwe could possibly include having staff go through these body scanner \n-- scanning images because this way, we can prevent a lot of the -- all \nof the individual cases that may have being -- being brought into \nincarcerated individuals.  We can say, hey, well, it was -- it was shown \nin a body scanning image.  This way it will decrease the amount of \nanything that's happening with substances, illegal chemicals, fentanyl \nwas brought up, all these things can be put to a -- a -- a stop.  \nNow, along with myself, I have had other colleagues \nthat have visited our State prisons and I've spoken with both sides.  I \nnever tend to take the side or opinion of one until I get an explanation \nor have a discussion with both sides.  And I -- and I've spoken with \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n223both sides, but I can tell you this:  There's one thing that found -- I \nfound very, very disheartening.  One hundred percent of the \nincarcerated individuals that I spoke with told me that the respect and \nthe treatment that they got from the National Guard was far better than \nwhat they were getting from the Department of Correctional Facilities.  \nOne hundred percent.  I've even got some of the word from the -- the \npeople from the Department of Correctional [sic].  They say most, or \nmajority, of the incarcerated individuals are there to serve their time \nand go home.  That's honesty.  So if you can take one and you add \none, you come up with two.  I just got the -- both sides of a story and \nit tells me that one side is being penalized because they can be.  \nBecause they don't have the -- the ability to speak out.  And that was \nthe purpose of going to visit these prisons to see what's truly going on \ninside.  So, until we go all go and visit multiple facilities, I don't think \nwe have the ability to speak specifically to one side, because you're \ndoing yourself a disservice and you're doing the rest of the State a \ndisservice.  \nI just know where we are currently is not where we \nshould be.  I know where we need to go is a lot further and so, with \nthat being said, even though I think this bill needs to be stronger, I still \nvote in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nColleagues, before we move forward, I just want to \nremind you debate is supposed to be referencing the bills that are in \nfront of us and we need to remain and keep our comments to debate \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n224on the bill.  We should not be referencing prior comments, or naming \nour colleagues, to be respectful in our conversation and reminding you \nto speak on the bill relating to the bills that are part of this package.  \nThank you. \nMr. Meeks.\nMR. MEEKS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MEEKS:  Savage:  Of an animal or force of \nnature, fierce, violent and uncontrolled.  Barbaric:  Savagely cruel, \nexceedingly brutal.  Hate:  To feel intense, or passionate, dislike.  \nRobert Brooks should still be here.  Instead his life \nwas taken when he was brutally beaten to death by corrections officers \nwhile handcuffed inside Marcy Correctional Facility.  This is yet \nanother tragic example of the inhumanity within this system.  We \ncannot stay silent, we must say his name.  Robert Brooks.  We must \nshare his story.  We must demand accountability.  His memory must \nfuel the fight for justice.  Robert Brooks was from Rochester, New \nYork, my district.  His family, his son, Robert Brooks Jr., his \ngrandchild, his parents, Mary and Robert, still live in Rochester.  And \nlike too many families, they are living with the pain that the system \nkeeps inflicting over and over again. \nI will vote for this oversight package today, because \ntransparency matters.  But transparency alone will not stop the next \ndeath.  Oversight alone will not stop the next life.  And make no \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n225mistake, lives are on the line right now.  For too long our justice \nsystem has prioritized punishment over people.  For too long it has \ntorn families apart.  It has devastated Black and Brown communities \nfor generations on.  But we had the chance this Session, we had the \nchance.  The chance to do more than monitor a broken system.  We \nhad the chance to change it, to save lives and we did not.  The Second \nLook Act, the Earned Time Act, the Marvin Mayfield Act; these are \nnot just bills, they're life-saving legislation.  They offer real chance at \nrestoration, at transformation and at reuniting families who have \nsuffered too long.  We cannot keep clinging to outdated, failed \nsentencing structures that serve no one.  These un just and \ndiscriminatory practices must end.  We must build real pathways to \nrelease and rehabilitation for a more equitable New York.  That is why \nI proudly sponsor the Marvin Mayfield Act.  To eliminate mandatory \nminimums, to restore judicial discretion and to put the focus back on \nthe person, their story, their capacity to heal and return home.  That is \nwhy I cosponsored the Earned Time Act and the Second Look Act.  \nBecause when people transform, they deserve a pathway home.  \nBecause families deserve hope.  Because everyday we delay, more \nlives remain at risk.  It is time for New York to lead with compassion, \nit is time for New York to lead with fairness, it is time for New York \nto lead with true justice.  We cannot stand idly by and add more \nnames to the list of the dead.  I vow to continue to stand with the \npeople and the fight to pass legislation that recognizes the full \nhumanity of every single person behind those walls and beyond.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n226I will be voting in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMs. Bailey. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield for some questions?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. DILAN:  Certainly, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMRS. BAILEY:  And this is going to be very \nawkward and I'm completely fine if your back is to me.  I won't take it \n-- \nMR. DILAN:  I -- I -- I love my mother.  I think she \ntaught me better.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Well, tell her thank you.  So --  \nMR. DILAN:  I wish -- I wish I could, but that -- you \nwouldn't know that part of my life.  But, go ahead --  \nMRS. BAILEY:  All right.  I'm going to try and -- I \ntry and have -- I have my questions, hopefully, by part in here, so, bear \nwith me while I kind of link them together.  I've tried to go back and \nread the original sponsor's justification s and memos, so I have an \nunderstanding as we're -- as we're kind of piecing it together.  \nSpecifically, under Part B, I just have a couple \ntechnical questions that I'm hoping that you might be able to -- to help \nwith.  So, with the comprehensive camera coverage and the footage \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n227would need to be retained for five years from a complaint, or legal \naction, I believe is -- is the wording.  It's on page 4, I think we're \nlooking at like from lines 5 to 14.\nMy question is, isn't a time -- it kind of ties into the -- \nthe... um, I just lost my train of thought -- the statute of limitations.  \nSo with the cameras being set up in areas that you might not be able to \nsee, we potentially could have some vacant buildings, so on and so \nforth.  As individuals inside the correctional facilities are monitoring \nthis film, it's my understanding that they're mandatory -- they have to \n-- if they see something that should not be occurring, they have to \nreport that.  \nMR. DILAN:  On the -- so, I guess there was several \nparts there.  So, I guess the -- on the camera footage and the -- the \nlanguage that you referred, yes, whether that is counter to Part J of the \nbill, which you referenced, I guess the -- the answer would be no, \nbecause they don't have the -- the footage now.  And, you know, to the \nextent that the lines that you cited to the extent that there's -- there's no \nclaims, it -- it wouldn't run counter to the provisions in Part J. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So the corrections officer or \nwhoever's monitoring the -- the film, if they identified something.  So \nsay there is an altercation in a hallway and they -- and they see that, \nwould they need to report that?  Therefore, then there would be an \nincident lodged.  I believe they currently, right now, have to \ntechnically report that; am I correct?  \n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n228MR. DILAN:  So, it -- it -- it kicks in when there's a \nreportage of staff misconduct.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And the only reason why I \nask as far as the statute of limitation piece of it, would then that \ncoverage need to be retained three years past that incarcerated \nindividual's release?  \nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMRS. BAILEY:  No.\nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMRS. BAILEY:  It would just be the five years?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes.  And then that would be -- to -- to \nfully answer your question, I know I -- I abbreviated it for the record \nbecause I believe we both understood it.  So, it -- it would stop -- it \nwould kick in -- they would have to do five years and it would only \nrequire to be held if there is misconduct. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So it's the five years then?  \nMR. DILAN:  Five years, yes. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay. \nMR. DILAN:  It doesn't impact Part J.\nMRS. BAILEY:  It doesn't effect Part J.  Okay.  Then \nmy next question is going to bring us to Part C with the public notice \nof such deaths and that notice must be reported within 24 hours on the \ndepartment's website.  If a family member requested that it not be \nreported for whatever reason, is that a viable request that could be \ntaken by the department?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n229MR. DILAN:  So, I -- I think I way -- the way I \nunderstand the bill is that they're required to post on their website after \n24 hours of notification of a family or next of kin.  But DOCCS does \nhave to complete those steps before it can be posted publicly. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So the family member or the \nnext of kin could request that it not be posted, potentially?  \nMR. DILAN:  I -- I'm sorry -- \nMRS. BAILEY:  No, you're absolutely fine. \nMR. DILAN:  I'm going to need you to repeat that.  \nAnd I guess to further, it also doesn't require that there's anything \nthat's identifiable.  So if the family chooses to remain private on the \nmatter and not have the names in -- in the public (indiscernible).  \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  Because --\nMR. DILAN:  If you can -- if you can repeat the \nquestion that I didn't hear again, I'd appreciate that.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  Oh, I -- so, my question it -- it had \nto do with that it has to be posted on the website within 24 hours.  \nThere's no language in there of what needs to be posted, it could just \nbe that there was, you know, there -- that someone passed away in a \nfacility.  I, you know, I don't know what that looks like.  \nMR. DILAN:  Correct.  And -- and -- and again, to be \nclear, 24 hours after the -- the family and next of kin has been notified. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Correct, within that 24 hours.\nMR. DILAN:  Yes.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And -- and the other reason \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n230why I ask is, as we move into Part D and this is just how my brain \nworks and I apologize for that, because I'm taking you on this merry \ntrail with myself.  When we go into the study on those deaths, is there \nany additional reporting that would then show up on the department's \nwebsite to maybe give closure to the public as to what was identified?  \nYou know, we -- we now are going to be posting that there may be \nthree or fourth deaths within the -- the correctional facility.  Some \nmay be of natural causes. \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  So -- yeah.  So, Part D is not -- \nnot DOCCS, it would be the State Commission on Correction [sic].  \nThe State Commission on Correction [sic], you know, does do that to \n-- to -- to a degree.  A lot of it is -- is heavily redacted and there's \nreasons for that and good reasons for that that would remain, but it \ndoesn't -- it deals with the State Comission on Correction [sic], not \nDOCCS itself. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And then Part E, where \nwe're talking about the autopsies that are done and where the county \ncoroner is notified and there's additional documentation that must \naccompany those county coroner reports now.  In counties that do not \nhave medical examiners, by statute, those coroner reports, along with \nany autopsy report, are filed with the county clerk.  So those original \nX-rays, or however they're going to be relayed, would then be coming \nthrough the coroner into the clerk's office for re -- for filing.  Am I \ncorrect in my understanding of that?  \n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n231MR. DILAN:  I think that -- I think in -- in those \nsituations, like most counties do, but I guess in those situations, we're \nnot sure the answer to that question.  But what I -- what I would say is \nthat to the degree that the items prescribed in the bill are included, \nthen they're complying.  It doesn't necessarily say how. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  And -- and the only -- the \nonly reason why I ask is everything that I could read in it stated that \ncopies of that would then go on to the different, you know, agencies \nthat would -- that would receive that information.\nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  Again, it -- it -- it's -- it's -- I see \nyour concern how it's -- it's close, but I think all this part does is \nprescribe what could be -- what is, not could be -- what is mandated to \nbe included in the autopsy reports -- \nMrS. BAILEY:  In that report, mm-hmm.\nMR. DILAN:  -- and as long as they comply with \nwhat's prescribed, they're compliant.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  I think those were my \nquestions.  I appreciate you answering them for me. \nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMRS. BAILEY:  As my colleagues have indicated, \nyou know, I -- I definitely think there are some pieces in this bill that \neveryone would be able to -- to find that makes it a little bit better.  \nYou know, as -- as I started the beginning of the year and we know the \nevents that -- that happens, you know, early on, out talking to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n232constituents that included incarcerated individuals' family members, it \nincluded correctional officers and then it later went on to including the \nNational Guard.  And I have followed up with many of those \nindividuals, you know, as I've read through this bill and I think all of \nthem would say that there's definitely pieces in here that will make it, \nor, you know, that are -- are measures that may be moving safety in a \n-- in a positive direction.  And I think at the end of the day, that's what \nwe need to look at.  Whether it's an incarcerated individual, whether it \nmay be civilian staff, whether it may be a corrections off -- a \ncorrectional officer, you know, whether it is our National Guard right \nnow.  I've always lived by the motto that, you know, it's our \nresponsibility as an employer to ensure that our employees go home \neither in the same condition that they walked in or a little bit better.  \nAnd I don't view this any differently.  Whether you're an incarcerated \nindividual or whether you are an employee in a correctional facility.\nSo, I commend the Speaker.  I thank him for \nanswering my questions.  I know some of them were pretty technical \nin nature.  And to be honest with you, I'm not exactly sure how I will \nbe voting on this bill.  I believe that there are steps that we can take to \nmove forward and do better.  But, I do believe that we have taken \nsome steps that will help everyone in our correctional facilities.  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Dais.\nMR. DAIS:  Will the sponsor yield?\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n233ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. DILAN:  Absolutely.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. DAIS:  Thank you.  I know it's a weird angle \nagain. \nMR. DILAN:  I'm -- I'm getting used to it. \nMR. DAIS:  Yes.  First, putting together -- when you \nfirst were putting this together, it was a large amount of bills that you \nwere sifting through and trying to figure out what was the best formula \nwhere we can make something move forward, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Well, the only thing I would correct to \nthat statement is not an \"I\", it's a \"we\", right?  The -- the caucus and -- \nand other members that -- who are not part of the caucus, you know, \nreally did a good job in looking at ideas that were already existing that \nwould help the current situ -- the current situation.  So, yeah, the only \nthing -- so, yes, it was more \"we\" than \"I\". \nMR. DAIS:  Agreed.  I do think it's safe to say you \nbelieve this is like the first step in -- underneath your committee to \nhelp transform our -- part of our correctional facilities? \nMR. DILAN:  So, it's a step.  I don't -- I don't think \nit's the first step.  We've taken steps in the budget that we've already \nadopted into law.  But, by no means do I feel this is the end and by no \nmeans do I believe anybody should take a victory lap here if we pass it \nout of this Body and get signed into law because, you know, folks are \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n234dying. \nMR. DAIS:  Understood.\nMR. DILAN:  And this will, you know, begin to \naddress the problem, but it -- it's not the end.  There's clearly more that \nneeds to be done. \nMR. DAIS:  Understood, and I agree.  In here with \nthe omnibus bill, we are focusing on accountability which I would \nargue protects not just the incarcerated individuals, but corrections \nofficers and staff.  Would you agree with that?  \nMR. DILAN:  I agree with that and it was very \nimportant to me.  So, you know, I don't want anything that we're doing \nhere today to be communicated that we find the items that are not \nincluded in this bill to be important or worthy of consideration of this \nHouse.  But I think the one thing that when we take a look as -- as a \ngovernment, you know, if we have an -- a -- a --an incident that \nresulted in a -- in a homicide and then as a result we see the floors in \nour government protections, as I've said many times here today, I felt \nit's incumbent that we -- we -- we fix that right away.\nMR. DAIS:  And to that point, by creating more \ntransparency, by having more accuracy, to ensure, for example, that \nwhen an autopsy can be expedited, that would actually give the public \nmore faith in our system that we can get quicker responses, quicker \nanswers when there's a cloud of suspicion under a possible homicide.  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  So -- yeah, it's -- it's important \nbecause I think, you know, I appreciate the -- the previous question as \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n235concerned about -- about how this works because every part of our \nState is -- is different.  And what may be easy in Brooklyn may be \nmore challenging in -- in other parts of the State.  Outside of this bill \nthere's -- while it didn't make it into this package, there is another \npiece of legislation that would model after what Connecticut does.  \nWhat Connecticut does is they have a centralized coroner's office for \nDOCCS facilities.  I would have loved to have gotten that today, but, \nyou know, it -- it didn't make it in and it's outside the scope.  But I \nthink it's -- the bill is also a starting point, you know, for all of us to \njust ask take a look at our agencies and our systems to see how they \nwork so that an issue that the previous questioner brought up that \ncould be alleviated if there was something more centralized and didn't \nput the -- the weight on the counties. \nMR. DAIS:  Thank you.  And in addition to the \nexpansion of cameras -- and obviously we're protecting private areas \n-- but I think there's a -- a key -- that would be a key step in ensuring \nnot just accountability, but protection of not just the incarcerated \nindividuals, but the correction officers and staff to make sure that if \nthere is an accusation of foul play, not only would it show one who \nmight have done something, but it could also acquit somebody or \ndemonstrate that they did not do something wrong in that situation, \ncorrect?  \nMR. DILAN:  Correct. \nMR. DAIS:  And so, therefore, by expanding the \ncameras we're not just focusing on the incarcerated individuals, but \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n236we're also focusing on the work conditions and the safety of the \ncorrection officers. \nMR. DILAN:  It is holistic, correct. \nMR. DAIS:  It's holistic.  In addition, a lot of people \ndon't talk about it to a degree from the correction officers' side, a lot of \npeople don't talk about hazing or -- or talk about where there's \npressure within your own job structure to do certain things.  And this \ncould actually protect correction officers from workplace -- workplace \nbullying from their -- from fellow correction officers, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  I would say to correction officers and \nDOCCS staff that is non-correction, like nurses and other people who \nprovide programs. \nMR. DAIS:  Right.  So, for example, so if a nurse in \nthe situation of Robert Brooks wanted to step in, that nurse might feel \na little bit more brave to step in that moment because knowing the \ncameras are there, they know that -- that they would be protected by \nadditional surveillance in that situation. \nMR. DILAN:  Or may be more willing to come \nforward with things that they saw that are clearly misconduct.  But \nbecause their security to -- to a large degree relies on the protection \nthat they get from a correction officer, they may be, you know, more \ninclined to speak up because they know what they're saying can be \nbacked up and corroborated by a video, they may be more likely to \ncome forward because they feel protected. \nMR. DAIS:  Thank you.  And my last question, I -- I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n237saw that we put a focus on chain of custody.  I think, again, that's \ncreating more transparency and accountability and, therefore, there \nwill not be questions of evidence being transferred over where people \nsay, Oh, it was doctored .  Or, Oh, we don't know if that's the real \nthing.  So do you think it was key, putting that in to ensure that by \nhaving chain of custody rules put in place that it will give more \nsecurity to the -- to these matters and give people more trust and faith \nin our investigations?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMR. DAIS:  Thank you.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.  \nMR. DAIS:  Obviously today has been full of \nemotions.  But one thing that we have within this Body is diversity \namongst our own occupations.  We have former prosecutors.  We have \njudges.  We have defense attorneys.  We have detectives.  We have \nformer correction officers.  We have -- we had a person that was an \nincarcerated person who can give an inside vantage point of what it's \nlike within our correction facilities.  I can tell you right now, I actually \nowe that person an apology, because I have a slight fear of prisons.  \nAnd when I was a -- first became an attorney, the first time I ever \nwalked into a holding cell to meet one of my clients, when I heard that \nclank behind me, I cannot explain to you the chill that vibrated down \nmy spine.  And I owe him a visitation to one of our facilities in my \ndistrict, and I've been hesitant because of this personal fear I have of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n238the one or two times I have been inside of one of our State and county \nprisons.  \nWhat we have to understand is just because someone \nis an incarcerated person does not mean they've lost their humanity.  \nYes, they might have done something wrong, but that does not mean \nthey do not deserve a second chance.  And which that means, as our \ncolleague said, just like our correction officers have the right to go \ninto their day of work and go home, so do the incarcerated individuals \nwithin those buildings have the right to serve their time peacefully, in \na manner where they can feel safe and can be rehabilitated and then \nstill have that option to go home.  If we do not create a safe \nenvironment to allow them to go home, then we have failed as an \nentity and as a Legislature in doing so.  They are not any less of a New \nYorker.  They are not any less of a human being.  They are not any \nless of a person because they committed a crime when they might \nhave been younger.  And one example I gave -- I know I use pop \nculture and movies, but in Shawshank Redemption , Morgan Freeman's \ncharacters in his last parole and they -- and they asked him, Are you \nsorry for what you did?  He says, Son, if I could talk to the young \nperson, he was dumb.  He made a mistake.  But that young man then , \n40 or 50 years ago, and the young -- and the man standing in front of \nyou now are two different people.  So we have to understand that if we \ncreate a safer environment within our judicial system, within our \ncorrections facilities, we are not just making it safer for the correction \nofficers, we're making it safer for the incarcerated individuals.  So we \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n239can let our emotions go to the side right now and ask -- ask ourselves \nthe very simple question, What is your humanity , and your humanity \nshould be we need these to be safer and better places.  \nIn full reality, the more prisons that we can close \nmeans we're doing something right.  That means our education system \nis getting better.  That means our social network, our social safety nets \nare getting better.  Because if we create more prosperity, if we create \nmore jobs, better education, I promise you that jail population will go \ndown.  We need to approach this from both sides of the aisle, both \nsides of the -- of the equation.  We need to make them safer.  We need \nto make them better.  We need to make sure that the correction \nofficers are properly staffed, properly trained, properly paid.  Have the \nproper benefits.  We need to make sure that they have access to \nhousing so we recruit qualified New Yorkers to go into these \n(indiscernible).  I know this is a tough job.  I will be the first person to \ntell you, I am not built for that job.  And I respect what they have.  But \nwe also have to make sure there are people there that respect the men \nand women within those facilities.  The fact that the -- I'm not \nsurprised, as a son of a vet, that the National Guard came into these \nfacilities and handled them with respect.  Because the one thing they \nteach you in the military, respect in -- in your bunks.  Respect for your \nfellow man and -- and -- and -- and within your camp.  And the fact \nthat demonstrates that with respect and with proper professionalism, \nthat these facilities can be better ran [sic] tells us that we can do better \nas a Legislature, as an Executive Branch.  If those National Guards, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n240those young men and women have demonstrated that we can run them \nbetter, then how can you say that we can't do it when they did it in a \nshort amount of time with how much training?  How much training do \nthose National Guard people have?  The only training that it seemed \nthey did have was to treat people with human dignity. \nWe have further steps to go.  I want to thank the \nsponsor for taking the -- the wishes, the 20 bills and trying to put them \ntogether to come with something that is putting us in the right \ndirection.  But just like any test, just like any -- any mission, the first \nsteps are the hardest.  But we have more to go.  There's gonna be \nnewspapers -- I'm sure the New York Post is gonna come out against \nus and say, Oh, we're being soft on crime .  We're not being soft on \ncrime.  What we are doing is solidifying our humanity.  We are \nmaking sure that we are holding ourselves accountable.  We're holding \nourselves transparent, and we are ensuring that those who are \nunderneath our jurisdiction  are doing their jobs.  If we do not do that \nthen we are failing as a Legislature.  That means as we move forward \nthis bill is the right step.  I want to make sure that we empower the \nCorrectional Association of New York to ensure that the correction \nofficers are safer.  That the incarcerated individuals are safer.  That \nthe staff members are safer.  That their families can talk to the \nmembers in those facilities.  The workers and those who are \nincarcerated. \nLast, we have to make sure that we come up with a \nmore humane system.  So that means with this being the first step, the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n241next step is looking at Earned Time, Second Look and Timely Parole \nand Elder Parole.  If we do this and work together and listen to \neveryone's opinion, to everyone's vantage point inside those facilities \nand outside, I do believe we can come together bi -- with a bipartisan \napproach that respects the wishes of our community and respects the \nwishes of our -- of our constituents, and also respects the dignity of \nthose who work within and those who are currently incarcerated. \nThank you kindly, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMs. Walker. \nMS. WALKER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOn the bill, please. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALKER:  There are presently 1.5 million \npeople incarcerated in America.  And when we think about the effects \nof mental health, the anxiety, the post-traumatic stress that the \nincarceration of individuals have not just on the person who is \nincarcerated, but on their entire family.  We think about the \ngenerational trauma that gets exasperated on an entire group of \npeople.  Because we have seen that the numbers favor some over \nothers. \nSo I want to commend the Black, Puerto Rican, \nHispanic and Asian Caucus, our Corrections [sic] Chair, the Speaker \nand the staff for recognizing that this is a critical time and it's a critical \ntime and a time of reckoning in our New York State prisons.  It is time \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n242to stand up for people who have been forgotten about by too many \npeople.  But remember.  I remember Robert Brooks.  He was a 43- \nyear-old Black man who was beaten in front of everyone for the world \nto be able to see.  It was embarrassing not just as a New Yorker, but as \nI was watching as this video was being shared all around the world on \nthat fatal day on December 9th in a Marcy Correctional Facility in \nOneida County.  His hands were cuffed behind his back, and he was \nattacked by more than a dozen corrections officers.  \nYes, this bill does provide a comprehensive study.  \nYes, this bill does provide a collection of data.  And yes, it does sure \nup our need for camera footage.  And we all recognize that oversight \nhelps to bring darkness to light.  But guess what?  In addition to the \nfact of him being punched, kicked, bloodied, bloody nose and face, \nthere's so many people who may be experiencing those same \nexperiences just today.  Like, there's a ticker in Times Square that will \ncalculate how many people are being affected by a certain situation.  I \nwonder what would happen if we had that ticker on -- on the New \nYork State Thruway as we were coming in here and we could all \nrecognize just how critical and crucial this moment is.  Because guess \nwhat?  Right after we mourned the death of Robert Brooks, another \nBlack man, 22-year-old Messiah, as we had heard, was killed in the \nnearby Mid-State Correctional Facility.  In only three months.  Since \nthe time of Robert Brooks' death, 75 more people have died in New \nYork State custody.  Seventy-five more families now carry that grief.  \nCan you imagine that?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n243So I'm voting for this bill, for this oversight bill \nbecause our incarcerated neighbors deserve, at a bare minimum, \ntransparency and accountability.  Far too often they are condemned in \nthe dark.  And we must fight even harder to ensure that the brutality, \nneglect and dehumanization does not persist.  Oversight alone, as we \nknow, will not stop the harm.  It tells us what happened after the fact, \nbut does not stop people from being trapped in conditions like this to \nbegin with.  \nWe have to end this culture of brutality by any means \nnecessary.  We know that the safest communities have the most \nresources, not the most police officers.  So we -- when we invest in \nour communities, we begin building men while they are still boys.  \nWe recognize that we need money for education, not for mass \nincarceration.  Since Robert Brooks was brutally murdered, we know \nthat he was doing so many different things that was trying to better \nhimself so that when he got back out into society he could be a better \nperson.  He earned his GED.  He studied sign language, horticulture, \nmaintenance.  He completed programs, made amends, and worked \nevery day to build a future for himself and his family.  He told his \nfather that he wanna do what dad did; mentor young people.  Be \ncredible messengers within the community to let people know what \nhappens when a -- a quick decision gets made that will land you up in \na place you may not want to be.  But instead of second chance -- \ninstead of a second chance to come home and do just that, he got a \ndeath sentence.  The purpose of our criminal justice system must be to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n244rehabilitate rather than excessively punish.  But instead, we keep \ntrapping predominantly Black and Brown people in our carceral \nsystem.  We need a new path forward, to which this bill is aligning us \nwith.  \nBrutalizing prisoners is illegal, it's inhumane and it \nmust stop now.  That is why sentencing reform is urgent.  Yes, it is \nimportant to oversight and document the harm.  But sentencing reform \nprevents it from even happening.  So of course some of the other bills \nthat was [sic] introduced in this package includes the Second Look \nAct, which gives judges the power to review long sentences after ten \nyears and recognize real transformation.  We know that the Earned \nTime Act, which is also a part of the original package, allows for \npeople to earn meaningful time off their sentence through work, \neducation and programming.  \nThere needs to be an opportunity for a release \nmechanism from this madness.  Continuing to keep people behind \nbars in barbaric situations as we've heard on behalf of the folk who are \nworking there each and every day, who are expecting to come home \nsafe to their families, and the people who are incarcerated.  When we \nkeep them caged up, a lot of times people talk about the -- a crab in a \nbarrel concept.  But guess what?  Yes, when crabs are in barrels \nthey're trying to pull down other crabs.  But barrels is [sic] not the \nnatural habit for a crab.  A crab in the ocean is thriving.  They're doing \nthe things that they need to be doing in order to take care of \nthemselves.  And so when you put people inside of a cage and they \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n245began [sic] to act cage-like and we sit on the sidelines and we are \nwatching like we are at a wrestling match, as we are at a boxing \nmatch, as we are at the Coliseum, this is the type of thing that we can \nexpect.  We know what the definition of insanity is.  When we keep \ndoing the same thing and expecting a different result, who is the \nproblem?  Who are -- who's really insane here?  \nSo of course we have to encourage growth and \nincrease safety for each and every person behind a prison wall.  And \nSecond Look is more than just a bill.  It's a chance to honor the \nhumanity of those who have grown, changed and served time beyond \n-- far beyond what the public demands. \nI come from Brownsville, as everyone knows, where \nfamilies live every day with the consequences of harsh, unyielding \nsentencing laws that tears families apart and destabilizes our \ncommunities.  Why, on Pitkin Avenue we have a hard time just \ngetting economic growth.  But we will watch each and every day as \nthe numbers of police officers who are filling the 73rd Precinct \ncontinue to double each and every day.  \nWe need to address mental health issues and trauma \nthat people experience at a young age in order for us to get at and lose \nthe cycles of violence before we decide to slam those individuals \nbehind cages.  We cannot simply monitor suffering.  We must prevent \nit.  We must recognize that there are -- are -- that -- that our people are \nfar more worse than their one-time mistake.  We must recognize more \noften than not that people should not be defined by their one mistake.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n246And we must build a system that believes in second chances and \nbelieves in our people.  Second Look would have created a pathway \nfor people to demonstrate transformation and deliver justice rooted in \ndignity and safety.  Although this may have been a missed opportunity \nin this present situation, it is not the end.  We will continue to keep \nfighting because we owe that to Robert Brooks.  We owe that to the \n75 others who have died since his death, and we owe that to all of the \nindividuals who are presently behind bars not just here in the State of \nNew York, but the entire 1.5 million Americans who are incarcerated \ntoday because New York State needs to continue to lead the way on \njustice, on criminal justice, and we must always do what's right for \nfairness, justice and equity.  \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMs. Tapia. \nMS. TAPIA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. TAPIA:  For too long, violence, neglect and \nabuse in our jails and prisons have been allowed to flourish in the \nshadows.  This package is changing that.  It's -- it's about pulling back \nthe curtain and holding out our institutions to a higher standard.  \nI am proud to sponsor one of the parts of this package \nwhich would mandate comprehensive camera coverage in our prison \nsystem.  With better cameras and reliable recordings, we can protect \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n247incarcerated individuals from abuse.  We know that cameras coverage \nmakes incarcerated individuals feel -- feel safer and make them safer.  \nIt will eliminate blinds spots and help to prevent abuse and \nmisconduct.  Together, these bills represent a clear demand for \naccountability, transparency, and humanity in our correctional system.  \nWe cannot allow more lives to be lost while we wait. \nI will vote in the affirmative.  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Would the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. DILAN:  Absolutely. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, sir.  Can you say your \nlast name for me just so I know I have it right?  \nMR. DILAN:  Mine?\nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah.\nMR. DILAN:  Well, it's Dilan, but I'm not sure -- I'm \nnot sure if it's supposed to be used.  I say that comically, not \noffensively.  Dilan.\nMR. MOLITOR:  No, I know.  So next time I use it \nI'll say it right.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n248MR. DILAN:  We could use it on a more personal \nlevel off the floor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah, thank you.  I appreciate that. \nI'd like to focus on Section F of this bill. \nMR. DILAN:  Certainly. \nMR. MOLITOR:  And if we could -- I'm looking at \npage 7, line 3, which -- which starts with the -- an addition to the \nExecutive Law.   \nMR. DILAN:  7-3?\nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah, page 7, line 3.  It starts -- \nstarts with an addition to the Executive Law. \nMR. DILAN:  Okay. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So if I understand this section \ncorrectly, this would give the Attorney General the opportunity to, \nlet's say, prosecute a case that occurs in any one of the correct -- in \nany correctional facility in the State of New York where the Attorney \nGeneral is already representing a, maybe a correction officer in that \nsame correctional facility. \nMR. DILAN:  It gives the Attorney General and their \noffice, I guess, the -- the authority to do that, and I think the -- the \nreason why this language was important, I think, is we -- we all know \nit's because of the re -- recusals.  But in other parts of the bill it \nrequires them to create firewalls to relieve them from (indiscernible).  \nIn this section it does.  But it -- it gives them the responsibility to \ncreate conflicts to -- to eliminate conflicts within the AG's Office, and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n249then to the extent that they can't do that, they have other tools to have \nto reduce the amount of instances where the Attorney General could -- \ncould -- would have to recuse.\nMR. MOLITOR:  So, the Attorney General -- let's \nuse a specific case here.  The Attorney General, let's say, is \nrepresenting two or three correctional officers out of a specific facility \nfor some sort of action that was filed against them.  Don't have to \nspecify what.  But the Attorney General is representing them, \ndefending them in that action.  While that is occurring or after that -- \nwhile that criminal -- while that action is pending, there's now a \ncriminal investigation against those same correction officers, and \nunder this legislation the Attorney General can say -- I'm sorry, the \nAttorney General under this section can say, I'm gonna hand off that \naction where I was defending the correction officers to a Deputy \nAttorney General who's screened off from my office and , I, myself, am \ngoing to prosecute  the correction officers . \nMR. DILAN:  So let me make sure I understand.  So \nthere's something that the AG's Office, maybe not the AG herself, \nthey're -- they're doing that -- they're representing a correction officer \non a complaint and potentially on the civil side, and now a potential \ncriminal issue comes up with the same officer?  Is that -- is that where \nyou're going?  \nMR. MOLITOR:  Yes. \nMR. DILAN:  Okay.  That's -- yes, correct. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And then -- well, before we \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n250move on to my next question, how do we, as the Legislature, have the \nauthority to do this?  To change the Executive Order to deal with \nconflicts of interest?  Where does this -- where -- where is our \nauthority coming from?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, so we're, obviously, the general \nlawmaking Body of the State.  So that's the first place it comes from.  \nBut then within there -- within this bill we -- we, you know, give the \nAttorney General's Office -- we -- we're mandating that she provide \nrules -- or that they, I shouldn't say he or she -- that they provide rules \nwithin the AG's Office to seek what we're looking to achieve in the \nbill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Are -- are you an attorney, Mr. \nDilan?  \nMR. DILAN:  No, sir. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  I'm not trying to trap you \nhere. \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, that's the sense I get. \nMR. MOLITOR:  But as you know, I'm sure, or \nsomeone's maybe told you, an attorney gets admitted to the Appellate \nDivision in which they wish to practice.  And they're required to \nfollow the Rules of Professional Conduct that are promulgated by the \nAppellate Division.  And the -- it's the Appellate Division that \noversees attorneys and addresses grievances and nets out discipline.  \n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n251MR. DILAN:  So I think the -- the answer to -- to \nyour question, if I'm correct, lies on page 7 beginning on line -- lines \n23.  It says the rules and regulations establishing (indiscernible) shall \nbe sufficient to satisfy the Rules of Professional Conduct regarding \nconflicts to protect the rights of State peace and police officers. \nMR. MOLITOR:  I -- I did see that language.\nMR. DILAN:  Okay.  So --\nMR. MOLITOR:  I did see that language.  The issue \n-- I'm sorry. \nMR. DILAN:  The short answer was that -- that part \nof the bill would establish the -- the protocols in which the Attorney \nGeneral would -- would have to follow, consistent with the question \nthat you just asked. \nMR. MOLITOR:  The issue I have is that the \nLegislature cannot tell the Judiciary what to do under the Constitution \nand the Judiciary Law.  It's the Judiciary's power and responsibility to \npromulgate rules and establish attorney discipline.  You can't --\nMR. DILAN:  So, I -- I don't --\nMR. MOLITOR:  -- craft -- let me finish my point. \nMR. DILAN:  I don't believe that's what we're doing.  \nWe are not telling them what to do, we are telling the Attorney \nGeneral's Office what to do. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Well, it says -- it -- it lays out what \nthe Attorney General is supposed to do, and then it says that if the \nAttorney General does what it says -- what it's supposed to do in this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n252legislation, that it will be sufficient to satisfy the Rules of Professional \nConduct.  But the Rules of Professional Conduct are administrated by \nour Appellate Divisions, and those Appellate Divisions are the ones \nwho determine whether conduct satisfies or doesn't satisfy the Rules \nof Professional Conduct. \nMR. DILAN:  So we're not changing ethical \nresponsibilities laid out by the Judiciary or an Appellate Division.  \nWe're saying that the rules that the Attorney General has to provide in \nher office have to be consistent with those. \nMR. MOLITOR:  But -- but there are rules and -- and \na lot of opinions, I might add, about those rules that say that an \nattorney -- the -- the Attorney General cannot both simultaneously \nrepresent a correction officer and prosecute a correction officer at the \nsame time.  And, in fact -- and, in fact, that's exactly why the Attorney \nGeneral needed to get a special prosecutor to prosecute the individuals \nwho were charged in the Marcy Correctional Facility incident. \nMR. DILAN:  Certainly.  So she has to use those \nrules to create a shield in her office that is prescribed by those -- by \nthe Judiciary and those Appellate Divisions and the conduct.  But they \n-- you know, the -- the Attorney General is the chief attorney of the \nState.  I'm certain that they are far more aware of how to do that than \n-- than I am, which is why we give her the flexibility to do that.  And \nthen in the event that they find that they cannot satisfy that, she still \nhas to -- has to recuse. \nMR. MOLITOR:  And that's what that second section \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n253is for.  I -- I respectfully disagree with you.  I think you have a major \nconstitutional problem with this particular piece of legislation.  But I \nalso think it's interesting that you have on line 31 -- 33 you have \nbasically the alternative, which is if the Attorney General has a \nconflict that they can't screen out and there's just no possible way that \nthey can take the case, they can instead apply to the -- to the county \nattorney where the incident occurred and -- to get a special prosecutor, \nwhich is exactly what happened recently. \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  \nNow, on -- on that section, that section is amending \n701 of the County Law.  And it adds a section to the County Law that \ndoes not currently exist; is that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And the way it stands right \nnow, if the Attorney General takes over a case or -- or decides to \nprosecute a case instead of the District Attorney from that county, the \nAttorney General has to get a special prosecutor that either work -- \nlike, lives in the county in which the incident occurred or a -- an \nadjoining county.  That's what the current law is; isn't that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  And that's how they're handling \nthe current prosecutions now. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Right.  This -- this legislation \nchanges that a little bit.  This -- in the specific scenario where the \nAttorney General has taken over a case from a district attorney and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n254has realized that there's a conflict, the Attorney General can petition \nthe court to get a special prosecutor.  It doesn't need to be somebody \nwho's in the county or somebody who's from an ad joining county, but \nanywhere in the State so long as the court determines that that person \nis -- has the necessary experience and qualifications to handle the \ncase; isn't that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And it also authorizes that \nspecial District Attorney or special prosecutor, we might say, to \nhandle -- to have all the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney \nGeneral and -- in that case, and also to then make an app -- to be \npermitted to make an application to the Department of Budget in order \nfor any necessary disbursements. \nMR. DILAN:  Correct. \nMR. MOLITOR:  And that's so -- that's -- in -- in the \n-- the circumstance where it's a big case, there's a lot of expenses.  \nThat special District Attorney won't be burdened by those expenses; is \nthat correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Correct. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  Mr. Dilan, thank you so \nvery much for answering my questions. \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So I think Part F is problematic.  \nYou know, this is, I think, maybe the issue with having an omnibus \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n255bill.  You're adding a lot of sections in there and, you know, maybe \nsometimes you don't catch an issue like this.  But I think that there's -- \nI think there is a big problem.  You know, under Article VI, Section 2 \nof the -- the New York State Constitution and under Section 90 of the \nJudiciary Law, it's the courts that oversee attorneys.  They handle \nadmissions.  They handle re -- certifications and recertifications, \ncontinuing legal education requirements, grievances and, ultimately, \nany disciplinary action.  So regardless of what this legislation says as \nto whether the Attorney General's actions will be considered a conflict \nor not or shall comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct or not, \nit's the Judiciary that's ultimately gonna decide.  And the problem, \nright, just from a practical standpoint, is if the Attorney General \ndecides to use that section and prosecute a case, thinking that they -- \nthe Attorney General has the authority to do, so they put that --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nMolitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Sorry. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gray. \nMR. GRAY:  Madam Speaker, will the sponsor \nyield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. DILAN:  This may prove to be the most difficult \n(indiscernible/cross-talk) --\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n256MR. GRAY:  So, first of all, let me thank you for \nanswering all the questions that you've been getting for hours on end.  \nI would only say that we would be willing to take questions from the \nother side of the aisle any time you want to let us get a bill to the floor.  \nSo thank you very much.\nSo -- \nMR. DILAN:  I'm trying to protect my appointments \non a few boards that we may be adding in this bill. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  You can stand on the other side \nof the desk if it makes you more comfortable.  \nSo, anyhow... So there's information that's generated \nfrom DOCCS that is regarding incarcerated individual violence on \nstaff, incarcerated individual violence on other incarcerated \nindividuals; is that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  And how is that -- how is that \ninformation gathered?  How's it generated?  \nMR. DILAN:  Largely right now it's -- it's -- it's \ngathered by DOCCS. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  But what's the -- what's the \ngenesis?  How did they get it?  Where does it comes from?  Does it \ncome from reports?  Where is it coming from?  \nMR. DILAN:  Could you repeat it?  Could you repeat \nthe question?  \nMR. GRAY:  Yes.  So where is the information \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n257actually originated from?  Right?  Is it reports that facilities are filing \nwith the central office?  \nMR. DILAN:  I believe so, yes. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  So with the -- Part B, the \ncomprehensive coverage with the cameras.  Do we expect any \nadditional reporting or any additional information coming from these \ncameras in the way of reports of violence that aren't otherwise \nreported?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  So it -- it -- it requires the \nCommissioner to do an annual report. \nMR. GRAY:  To do an annual report on everything \nthat's captured on these cameras in terms of violence that is not \nreported otherwise?  \nMR. DILAN:  Only regard [sic] to the actions of the \ncameras.  Actions -- \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  Okay.  So now covered -- so \nthey're in all of this -- they're in all around in the facilities.  Would this \ninclude visit rooms?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  All righty.  So we'll capture all \nthe information there.  If there's contraband coming in from the visit \nrooms we'll be able to capture all of that information; is that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Along with a lot of hugs and kisses. \nMR. GRAY:  Pardon? \nMR. DILAN:  Yes, along with a lot of hugs and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n258kisses.\nMR. GRAY:  More than that, sir.  I've been in -- just \nso you know, I'm speaking from experience.  I have been in over -- \nover a dozen facilities and the visit rooms, and you'll get -- you'll see \nmore than kisses.  Just trust me on that one.  \nSo, now, do we know in these facilities where the \nviolence and specifically what sections of these facilities the violence \nis occurring?  \nMR. DILAN:  I -- DOCCS may know.  I don't know \nthat the -- the Legislature may know in terms of specifics.  But --  \nMR. GRAY:  But we know generally what areas that \nit happens in; the yard, where it could be -- right?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  Again, I think DOCCS -- \nDOCCS may know.  I think -- I don't think we looked in this bill to \ncapture that, you know, level of --  \nMR. GRAY:  We're talking about transparency --  \nMR. DILAN:  Of detail. \nMR. GRAY:  So we want transparency.  We want to \nknow everything that's going on in these facilities for the protection of \nthe incarcerated individuals, for the protection of the uniformed staff, \nfor the protection of the civilian staff; is that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.  But as to the -- the -- as it \nrelates to your question, the specific locations of -- of where they \nhappen, you know DOCCS will -- DOCCS will know that.  They'll be \nable to address that.  And I think in one of the initial steps that the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n259Governor did in result -- as a result of the -- the -- the homicide was \nthey enacted partnerships with -- with outside firm to conduct, like, \nsafety gap analyses -- safety gap analyses and using other data that -- \nthat they will get from these outside providers to kind of address \nproblematic areas.  That will be a partnership that DOCCS has \nongoing.  It's not really captured in this bill, but it -- it has -- it -- what \nyou're asking has been addressed by the Executive as part of their \nreforms that they can do at that branch but it's not in legislation. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  So let me just share that a lot of \nthe violence in these facilities happens in the shower area, right?  So --   \nand that's one area that's not gonna be covered -- \nMR. DILAN:  Yes.\nMR. GRAY:  -- under this.  So we're gonna have a \nglaring omission of activity in these facilities, correct?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. DILAN:  So you're -- you're -- you're right that \nthat is a -- a problem. \nMR. GRAY:  Yes. \nMR. DILAN:  But I think you can see for humane \nreasons why we left that out.  But what will be captured is areas of \ningress -- egress will be captured by camera. \nMR. GRAY:  Yes.  So -- and you're talking -- in that \nsame section you're talking in Section [sic] B, line 44 it talks about \nfixed stationary cameras, and to capture both audio and visual footage. \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n260MR. GRAY:  Okay.  So is there any objections to \ncapturing the audio only in those general -- those other areas where \nwe can -- where it -- where it could be heard what's going on?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yeah, but I -- I guess this was done \nthis way because, you know, previously there -- there -- there were \nissues about privacy in bathrooms. \nMR. GRAY:  Visual?  Well, I mean, you could say -- \nyou could say it's audio, but it's --\nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.\nMR. GRAY:  -- mainly visual.  I would say that the \nconcerns would be probably more --  \nMR. DILAN:  And -- and, look, I would say I see \nwhere you're getting and it's a -- it's a concern.  And -- and like you \nsaid earlier, this is a first step.  This is not -- this is not the end.  And if \nit proves to be problematic, especially after the -- the work of the \noutside entity that the Governor's office has appointed to be the -- one \nof the first reforms, you know, after their work is concluded, you \nknow, I would have to imagine -- and that's not the only aspect, I'll get \ninto that later -- I have to imagine that would generate things that \ncould become further legislation.  But right now, you know, that's \nkind of where we are. \nMR. GRAY:  Yeah.  And I would just suggest that \nmaybe we'd love to capture some of the information in reports that are \ncoming from all this improved transparency so we actually can tell \nhow it's working.  It's one thing to implement it; it's another thing to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n261know that it's actually functioning, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Correct. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  Just one other quick -- or a \ncouple other quick questions.  Enforcement on the -- page 4, lines 17 \nthrough 20.  That -- that section there really reads that it's more \npenalty, it's not enforcement.  So could you talk a little bit more about \nthe enforcement of these camera operations?  \nMR. DILAN:  You're talking about the -- the \nenforcement that's granted to the Inspector General?  \nMR. GRAY:  That is correct.  The way that reads, to \nme, it reads more penalty-driven than it is enforcement-driven. \nMR. DILAN:  That is how it's enforced, by -- by \npenalty. \nMR. GRAY:  It -- it doesn't say how it's enforced.  \nThat's my point.\nMR. DILAN:  Well, it -- it --\nMR. GRAY:  It talks about the penalties -- \nMR. DILAN:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. GRAY:  -- but it doesn't talk about how it's \nenforced.  \nMR. DILAN:  So it's -- so it -- it -- it -- the -- yeah, so \nthe Inspector General can -- can do annual audits, and in -- in the \nfurther line, line 20, the -- the Inspector General can take corrective \nactions.  And I guess -- \n(Pause/conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n262Okay.  So I guess -- is your concern -- I guess your \nconcern is in and around the Inspector General's authority to impose \nmonetary penalties?  \nMR. GRAY:  That's a penalty.  I want to know the \nenforcement.\nMR. DILAN:  Gotcha.\nMR. GRAY:  How it's being enforced or how it's \nbeing audited.  How it's gonna work, how -- how the enforcement \nactually looks. \nMR. DILAN:  Annual audits.  But what I would say \nis that this is something that the Administration wants to -- wants to \ndo.  I would say if -- if at any point a future administration doesn't \nwant to do it, then, you know, the powers of -- of -- of the Inspector \nGeneral could -- could kick in.  But it -- it's enforced here. \nMR. GRAY:  Well, I would say anybody that installs \ncameras actually wants them to all work.  I happen to represent a -- a \npower facility that straddles -- that straddles the international border \nfrom Canada to the United States.  And we had an individual that \nwalked all the way underneath, through the bowels of the dam from \nCanada to the United States, and found that over two dozen cameras \nwere not working.  So my point is that there has to be -- is there going \nto be some enforcement versus just after-the-fact penalties?  But we'll \nagree that that is kind of incomplete. \nMR. DILAN:  So the -- the Inspector General under \nthis section is empowered to do annual audits --  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n263MR. GRAY:  Okay.\nMR. DILAN:  -- to ensure compliance under this \nsection.  So at that point, you know, the -- the Governor or the \nLegislature or the rest of government can -- can take action. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  All righty.  Then Part C, I just -- \njust briefly on Part C.  It says, the department shall promptly notify the \nnext of kin or any person designated as a representative.  Can you \ndefine that second -- the latter part of that statement?  Who -- what is \n-- who classifies as a designated representative?  What are the \noptions? \nMR. DILAN:  Well, that's current law.  We're not --  \nwe're not amending that. \nMR. GRAY:  You're not amending that. \nMR. DILAN:  No. \nMR. GRAY:  It's underlined.  That's new -- that's new \nwording.  Line 43, 44.  \nMR. DILAN:  So if you see in -- just above in Part C \non line 40, it's already written in current law and not -- not underlined. \nMR. GRAY:  Okay.\nMR. DILAN:  So we're just copying it and putting it \n-- and repeating it there.\nMR. GRAY:  Okay.  All righty.  And then just line \n47, you refer to -- and again, one of my colleagues asked it earlier, I'm \ngonna re-ask it because you referred to an autopsy report -- and in this \ninstance it just says \"autopsy report.\"  But if you go to Part E and line \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n26433, 34 it talks about autopsy and it talks in conjunction with \ntoxicology.  So is that an omission in Part C, toxicology? \nMR. DILAN:  So -- and I believe this question was -- \nMR. GRAY:  Was asked. \nMR. DILAN:  -- was asked of me earlier, also.  I've \njust been informed that toxicology is already covered in current law. \nMR. GRAY:  Covered in -- in C? \nMR. DILAN:  No, no, in current law. \nMR. GRAY:  Oh, in current law.  Got it.  Got it.  \nOkay.  That's it, Mr. Dilan.  I appreciate it very much.  Thank you for \nyour time --\nMR. DILAN:  Thank you.\nMR. GRAY:  -- and answering the questions. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  And recognized that once again were in an awkward \nposition.  You're not gonna hurt my feelings --\n(Indiscernible/Cross-talk)\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. DILAN:  I will yield.  And I'd say this is \nprobably the best position I've been in all day.\nMS. WALSH:  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, I'm glad I \ncould help.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n265MS. WALSH:  Thank you very much, Madam \nSpeaker, and thank you to the sponsor.  So we've been debating, \nobviously, this bill for -- for several hours.  I can appreciate that you -- \nthat some of the questions I'm asking may be redundant.  I'm gonna \njust try to just go through them quickly.  And I -- and I do apologize if \nyou are repeating yourself.  But I just want to be absolutely clear.  I'm \ngonna -- the good news is I'll take it from Part A and work forward, so \nat least they'll be in some kind of order.  \nOkay.  So Part A, the video disclosure relating to the \nincarcerated individual's death.  Okay.  So this part -- am I correct that \nthis part has to do with not only DOCCS, but also local correctional \nfacilities; is that correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Local facilities are exempt.  This \napplies to State facilities only. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  My notes had said that for this \nsection it applied to local correctional facilities.  So if I'm mistaken, I \napologize. \nMR. DILAN:  So I have to reverse myself.  You -- \nyou are correct. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  But to your knowledge is there \nany other part of this entire omnibus bill that relates to or impacts \nlocal correctional facilities, or is it just this Part A?  \nMR. DILAN:  Just this Part A.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Very good.  So this says that \nthe Attorney General's Office will -- they'll be disclosure to the AG's \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n266Office of Special Investigation any video footage the Office deems \nrelevant to the death of an incarcerated individual within 72 hours of \nthe incident, including cases involving correctional officers.  Okay.  \nSo it said that the footage will include recordings from fixed or \nstationary cameras, body-worn cameras, handheld devices.  And then \nit says or any other recording equipment used by correctional staff at \nthe time of the incident.  So I'm hoping that you can help me \nunderstand.  I thought, but maybe I'm wrong, that correction officers \nare not allowed to have their cell phones on their person while they're \ndoing their shift.  Is that -- or are we trying to get at maybe what a \nstaff member might be carrying, that they can carry?  Like, are we \ntalking about cell phones here that they might have?  \nMR. DILAN:  No, this -- this --\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. DILAN:  We don't change cell phone policy in \nany way --\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. DILAN:  -- in this bill.  But we do allow for, you \nknow, the audio of -- of, you know, any other DOCCS-approved \ndevice that may pick up recordings to be used. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So when it says \"any other \nrecording equipment\", then, could you just tell me what you're \ncontemplating with that?  If it's not cell phones, then what would be?  \nOr is it just a catch-all meant to just cover anything?  \nMR. DILAN:  So I'm -- I'm told DOCCS sometimes \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n267use handheld video cameras and have other means so that if any other \nDOCCS-approved devise captures something that it can be captured \nthis way.  If they have devices that we don't know of now or that \ndevices are invented or manufactured in the future that are DOCCS- \napproved that they can be captured under this section. \nMS. WALSH:  Very good.  Okay.  And when we're \ntalking about that the Office will deem relevant to the death, did -- so, \nI mean, it's obvious to me that the -- an incident leading up to the \ndeath of the incarcerated individual would obviously be included in \nterms of video footage of that.  But how far back in time may the \nfootage go?  Do you -- is there any sense of that?  Like, are we \nlooking through the entire day of the individual or the week of the \nindividual, or it is really just the incident itself? \nMR. DILAN:  So it -- it gives -- it gives them \ndiscretion to deem what -- what footage is -- is relevant to turn over. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. DILAN:  If -- you know, if it's clearly by when \nthey look at it not -- not relevant, they're not required to turn it over. \nMS. WALSH:  But it's in the sole discretion, the way \nthat this is -- the way I'm reading it, it's in the sole discretion of this \nAG's Office of Special Investigation to determine what is relevant and \nhow far back maybe they'd want to go, correct?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes.  Correct.  \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right.  That's fine.\nAnd then the footage, it says that it will be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n268maintained by the AG's Office confidentially, and it will determine \nredactions according to its published video release policy.  So --  \nMR. DILAN:  I would be a little bit more specific \nwith that question.  It's the AG's Office of Internal -- of OSI, to be \nmore specific. \nMS. WALSH:  Very good.  Okay, that special unit.  \nOkay.  \nAnd so let's move on to Part B, the comprehensive \ncamera coverage.  So -- let's see -- it says -- it says that facility \nsuperintendents are responsible for regular assessments of camera \nplacement, functionality, addressing any blind spots and non- \nfunctioning cameras.  When it says \"regular assessments\", nothing is \ncalled out.  So is that gonna be left to the DOCCS Commissioner to \nestablish what regular assessments means?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes.  And I have to imagine that they \nwould do that in consultation with the partners that they are \ncontracting with that the Executive released as part of their reforms as \nwell. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Very good.  And can you just \ndescribe or distinguish for me the difference between one year of \nretention of footage and the five years?  What -- what is gonna trigger \nthe longer period of time for retaining the footage?  \nMR. DILAN:  Okay.  So, ordinary is when you're \nthen -- so line 7 where -- \n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n269So the five years kicks in based on the language on \npage 4, line 7.  It reads allegation or report of any staff or any staff \nmisconduct or rule violation.  That's where the five-year period gets \nkicked in. \nMS. WALSH:  And -- and just -- when I was reading \nthat -- and I appreciate you pointing that out to me where it was -- it -- \nthat seems extremely broad to me because that doesn't just include, \nlike, written complaints, and that could mean -- that could mean a lot \nmore than that, right?  And it could be involving even something as, \nrelatively speaking, as small as a rule violation, right?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes, that's what the language says.  \nYes. \nMS. WALSH:  So would it be -- would it be fair to \nsay or fair to conclude that footage will more than -- more likely than \nnot, if there's been any kind of a complaint, that it would be held for \nthat longer period of time?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right.  And, let's see.  Let's \nmove on to Part C, the notice of death in correctional facilities.  So it \nrequires DOCCS to promptly notify the next of kin.  Once again, \npromptly.  Is that something that's going to be just at the discretion of \nDOCCS to identify what -- I mean, I understand what the ordinary \nmeaning of the word \"promptly\" is.  But is there going to be a specific \ntime frame set for that?  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes.  And the -- the current practice is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n270within 24 hours.  And as you can see in, you know, the few words \nbefore, the -- the part that we're striking in -- in law, even though \nDOCCS' current practice is 24 hours, we've [sic] striking the words \n\"be responsive for inquiries from.\" \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Yes.  Okay, thank you.  I \nappreciate that.\nI'm going to skip over Part D, the study on deaths \nbecause I think that that's been covered and I think that that's pretty \nself-explanatory to me.  \nPart E, the enhanced autopsy reporting.  A question I \nhad was must all incarcerated individual deaths be autopsied under \ncurrent -- under our current law and regulations, or only suspicious \nones?  And does this Part E change that in any way?  \nMR. DILAN:  So, it doesn't change current law or \npractices. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And what is the current \npractice?  Is it only for suspicious -- so, for example, I -- I was \nthinking of somebody that is -- that has not been early released, but \nthey have cancer.  They have terminal cancer and they pass away in \nthe -- in the correctional facility.  Would that be an autopsy that would \nbe done automatically or what -- you know, what would be the policy \nabout that?  If you know.  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. DILAN:  So we believe it's a -- it's an aut -- an \nautopsy under all circumstances for folks in DOCCS' custody. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n271MS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right.  And last question on \nthis section. \nMR. DILAN:  And I would say we believe. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, no, I understand.  I appreciate \nthat.  I know -- I know that some of the questions I'm asking are -- are \na little bit outside the scope of the bill because I'm asking about what \nthe current practice is and you may not know that.  I appreciate that.\nMR. DILAN:  Yeah.\nMS. WALSH:  But as far as autopsy, do you happen \nto know, can family or next of kin reject or say no to an autopsy, or \njust by the sheer fact that the individual has been incarcerated, do they \n-- does the family or next of kin have no say about whether the \nautopsy is gonna occur or not, it will occur?  \nMR. DILAN:  Now, you're talking current law, right?  \nMS. WALSH:  Yes.  \nMR. DILAN:  Yes.  So we -- I would say we are \nunsure.  But there -- there were other proposals that -- that -- we -- we \ntook a look at as we looked at autopsies to allow families who maybe \nwere suspicious of an autopsy report to get their own independent one \ndone, paid for by the State.  That was a proposal -- one of the \nproposals that we looked at and didn't quite make it.  But it -- it was \nsomething we considered.  But in terms of their -- their current rights, \nI'm -- I'm unsure.  We'd probably have to get back to you on that. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  That's fine.  I was just \nwondering because some -- some families for religious reasons or \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n272other reasons would not want an autopsy, and I just -- I was just \ncurious.  That's okay, we can move on. \nMR. DILAN:  Certainly, if that right exists in current \nlaw this doesn't --\nMS. WALSH:  It doesn't change it.\nMR. DILAN:  -- this doesn't encroach on anyone's \nreligious rights to do that in any way in this bill. \nMS. WALSH:  In this bill.  Thank you very much.  \nOkay.\nSo I'm gonna skip over Part F because I believe that a \nprevious debater covered that section thoroughly.  And I will even \nskip over Part G.  And now looking at Part H.  Okay.  So I noticed -- \nand I see my time is -- is swiftly passing, so let me just ask one quick \nquestion about this one.  I did a little -- a little looking up about what \nthe State Commission of Correction does, and it -- and it defined it as \nan independent watchdog over State or local correctional facilities \ntasked with ensuring the safety, health and operational standards of \nfacilities.  So it -- it mentioned different cohorts that have to be \nincluded in the -- in the Commission's composition, but it didn't \ninclude anybody from the correctional or law enforcement community \non there.  Is -- it seems like that person or that individual maybe \nwould be representation that you would want.  I wanted to give you a \nchance to explain why they were not included in that. \nMR. DILAN:  In terms of what, membership?  \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, to be on the Commission. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n273MR. DILAN:  So, yeah, they're -- they're not \nspecifically lined out as mandated to be included, but they're not \nexcluded because there's nothing that prohibits --\nMS. WALSH:  Oh, I see.\nMR. DILAN:  -- nothing that prohibits any one of the \nappointing authorities from placing law enforcement or corrections \nofficers to this board as a member. \nMS. WALSH:  Do you know if anybody currently on \nthere is -- is a member of law enforcement or corrections?  \nMR. DILAN:  I believe the President is a serving \nsheriff, a former -- a former sheriff of one of our counties. \nMS. WALSH:  That -- that's great.  Okay.  Thank you \nso much.  And just, let's see.  Part J.  I know there's been a lot of \ndiscussion about that.  So my understanding is that -- that it basically \n-- what this part is doing is it's creating tolling, where, you know, \nduring your period of incarceration your -- your right to bring suit is \nbeing tolled.  Like it would almost, like, for infancy or for other -- you \nknow, other issues the law would toll it so that your time to \ncommence a lawsuit about something that occurred during your \nincarceration will not start to run until you leave. \nMR. DILAN:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  I -- I just wanted to clarify \nthat.  Thank you so much.  I know I ran through a million things at \nonce. \nMR. DILAN:  No, that's fine.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n274MS. WALSH:  I just (indiscernible/cross-talk) -- \nMR. DILAN:  It's actually the most organized \napproach I've had to deal with today.  I appreciate it.  \nMS. WALSH:  Well, I've had a little time to consider \nit here.  So thank you.\nMR. DILAN:  Thank you.\nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, on the bill, please. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you.  So I appreciate all these \nanswers.  I have to say that there -- there is a lot in here that I really do \nlike.  I do like it because I'm a big believer in body-worn cameras and \ncameras generally.  I think that it tends to work to help both -- you \nknow, both sides, all sides to issues to figure out what really \nhappened.  I think we need to work together to build a better system.  I \nthink that we -- we need to make sure that we have enough corrections \nofficers.  We need to train them properly.  We need to -- ensure \ncorrection officers' safety, especially the women COs that I've met \nwith.  We need to reduce the toxic workplace environment.  We need \nto reduce and eliminate contraband.  We need to reinstitute \nrehabilitative programs that have been suspended because we don't \nhave the good ratios that we need in order to run these programs.  You \nknow, I think that the problem with an omnibus bill, and I'm running \ninto it right now, is that when you have ten different bills all lumped \ntogether and the debate time's been cut in half a couple years ago are \nwe're getting to a point where we're maxing out, we can't give these \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n275things the attention that they deserve.  But I tried.  \nSo, thank you.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Dilan. \nMR. DILAN:  Madam Speaker, on the bill.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. DILAN:  So, I -- I just want to thank everybody \nin the Chamber for the discussion.  As you can see, you know, the -- \nthe -- the amount of passion and the range of emotions are -- are high.  \nAnd I know there's some folks out there who are frustrated, both in the \nChamber and out of the Chamber, who are frustrated that we're not \ngoing far enough.  But I would say, look, this is a -- a step.  I clearly \ndon't believe that we're ending here.  I think the -- the first step, you \nknow, I was taken by -- it was taken by the Executive.  It was an \nimportant step -- step.  It was stuff that the Executive could do, to \nsome degree, without legislation.  I mean, the first thing they did after \nthe incident was install a new superintendent at Marcy.  You know, \nthey -- they expanded DOCCS's whistleblower protections.  You \nknow, they -- launched partnerships with -- with private entities to do \nsafety gap analysis, to do public health and human rights analysis of \nprograms in -- in prisons.  They've done, you know, a host of things.  \nIncluding the one to me that was most important, that they created a \nnew dedicated unit on the future of prisons within New York State at a \nnonprofit agency.  I believe it's a nonprofit agency, I'm not sure as I \nlook it.  Those were the first steps that the Executive could do on their \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n276own and I believe that was the -- the first step.  \nI think the next step that we did collaboratively was \nenact protections and do things in the budget like providing the \nfunding for cameras.  You know, providing expanded fund -- funding \nfor our independent watchdogs on DOCCS like CANY and like the \nState Commission on Corrections.  I would say, in -- in that regard, \nthere's a lot to do.  You know, prior to this year's budget, for an entity \nthat is supposed to be the State's independent watchdog of DOCCS, \nmaybe almost in the model of -- and I say \"almost\" because it's \ndifferent, but almost in the model of New York City's CCRB and they \nreceived through -- consistently $3 million in -- in -- in appropriations \nto independently oversee an agency that has a budget of over -- over \n3 billion.  \nYeah, we -- we need to do more there, but it -- it -- it \nbecame, you know, clear at -- at -- at some point that at some point in \nour history, that this agency's powers had been gutted to be the \nindependent check that they were supposed to be when they were \nfounded in the 1800s after the reforms that were made by law after \nAttica.  Which, by the way, were done by Republican administrations, \nacross the board, which were okay under -- but even at that time, they \nwere done in conjunction and in negotiation with incarcerated \nindividuals.  And as we all know -- all know, Attica did not turn out \nwell for those who were under incarceration.  So, to have the -- the \nchecks -- the checks that people of this State have been attempting to \ncorrect for over 150 years in our history, clearly says that our system \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n277of independent checks are -- are -- are broken.  \nSo, that was an important step to take in the budget.  \nYou know, expanding DOCCS' internal OSI, because there's two \ndifferent ones; one within DOCCS and then one within the Attorney \nGeneral's Office.  Collaboratively, we allowed DOCCS to have that \nexpanded authority because DOCCS can also do the same thing \nwithin DOCCS.  And people who are under incarceration can also \nmake complaints to DOCCS OSI and they can have those complaints \nsubstantiated and proved by DOCCS OSI and they can do it.\nWhat most folks -- thankfully, we didn't talk about \nthe -- the information and reporting that OSI has to do.  I think it was \npretty clear and -- and -- and rather noncontroversial.  That's why I say \n\"thankfully\".  I think people's -- as they reviewed the bill, it was pretty \nclear to see what we were trying to achieve.  The feeling at the time is \nthough, if -- if we're gonna give DOCCS -- DOCCS OSI, you know, a \nturn -- internal members to do a reporting on these incidents, that it \nshould not remain within DOCCS.  That even the investigations that \nare conducted within DOCCS, also be made public.  So, that was an \nimportant transparency piece.  \nSo, today is -- is another step.  And I know folks, \neven though, you know, they -- they -- they haven't may be said it, or \nsome have said it and I -- whether you have said it, or -- or haven't \nsaid it, I certainly appreciate that you either said it or didn't, because \nfor the folks that didn't say it, I know the sentiment is that this doesn't \ngo far enough and that we do need to do -- to do more.  I certainly \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n278agree.  And that's why I highlighted some of the steps that the \nGovernor made with some of those partners, because I -- I believe \nwhen their workers concluded that it will give us the opportunity to \nlook at potential for new reforms and -- and -- and new legislation.  \nI would also like to, you know, just say that the \naccountability, transparency and oversight is only one approach.  I \nthink when there are crisis and is clear to the public, that your \ngovernment apparatus has failed, it's incumbent upon all of us to \nattempt to fix that.  But it doesn't, in my mind and here.  There's a lot \nof folks outside this building that are disappointed with what we are \ndoing here today, because they don't believe it goes far enough.  So, I \nwould say that things like sentencing reform and -- and parole reform \nare things that -- that are important to me.  A lot of that stuff did not \nsurvive it and -- survive and -- and -- and make it into this package.  \nAnd some of them -- some of them, you know, did get close.  And I -- \nI'd cite one, things like the Earned Time Act, you know, the Earned \nTime Act was put into the budget of -- by the Executive.  You know, \nthere -- there is a member that has -- that carries in the piece -- \nindependent piece of legislation that we're considering.  And there's -- \nthere's been discussions on the -- the -- the mechanisms of Earned \nTime Act and folks have gone back and forth, but they can't agree on \nthose mechanisms.  But I would say that the fact that the Governor, \nnot anybody in the Legislature, injected Earned Time Act into the \nbudget, means maybe we don't yet agree on the mechanisms for folks \ndoing well, to earn time off.  At least shows that the Governor's at \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n279least willing to aid -- engage in the discussion.  So, I think while \nthings like that didn't survive, I do -- I do think that ideas like that \nhave taken important step forward -- important steps forward as we \ncontinue to try to solve these problems in the future.  \nI think on -- on sentencing reform and parole reform, \nthere are a lot of ideas that the caucus came up with, that advocates \ncame up with that I like.  And, you know, Second Look Act \nspecifically, which I found to be pleasantly surprising, was, you know, \nsaid to be supported on -- on record by, you know, one of the highest \nmembers of the court in this State.  But that was encouraging to me, as \nI sat there.  So, to the folks that feel like we haven't gone far enough in \nthat regard, I would say, we're a lot closer than you'd think.  And you \nknow, they expressed frustration that they will probably never see \ntheir reforms being enacted in their lifetime.  \nAnd I -- I remember, like, one of the first bills that I \nhad to deal with when I was here was Medical Aid in Dying.  I was \ndead set against that when I got here.  I said, oh, that -- that's never \ngonna go.  I'm not gonna allow that to go.  It is impossible to pass that \nbill.  Eleven years later, this Body passed it and it passed the Senate in \nthis -- before the Governor for her consideration.  So, I would say that, \nyou know, if you feel like that hope is gone, you know, Medical Aid \nin Dying is, you know, a good example of how to -- how to keep \ngoing on and keep pushing.  So, I encourage you guys to do so.  \nI just want to take a moment to just basically thank, \nyou know, the caucus and colleagues and you know, everybody else \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n280that has expressed an interest in -- in getting this done.  This is all of \nour work.  This is not just my work.  I think everybody has, you know, \nput forward their ideas and done things.  And I know folks see me \nmaybe tearing up now, but, you know, a previous speaker said that no \none ever cried and I was personally happy that during the budget \ndiscussion no one saw me cry, because I did.  And maybe one person \nsaw me, but I chalked it up to allergies because I tear without, you \nknow, I tear without hoofing.  That's just the way I do it.  I didn't think \nI would do it today because I told myself, don't.  Just don't.  But this is \nimportant.  It's not partisan.  You know, this -- this is -- it belongs to \nall of us, this system.  The failures of it are on all of us while we're \nhere.  \nI told myself I would not do this.  \nYou know, I'm fine.  My kids are home safe.  That's \nnot the case for everybody.  And the amount of calls that I got and the \namount of letters that I got from folks that said they're concerned \nabout their family and their kids are struggling.  And I -- I appreciate \nwhat the caucus has done, you know, in their advocacy to -- I'll take it.  \n(Handed tissue) I'm not shy.  It's already out there.  Might as well \njust -- just deal with it.  And I appreciate the passion and the emotion \nof -- of -- of everybody, because this is really hard to talk about this in \na real way without getting emotional.\nNow, I've been fortunate, right?  I don't have -- I have \nfamily inside.  Other people have family inside in this Chamber.  \nFolks have talked about the experiences of their family -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n281(indiscernible) -- but my family's been beat up, too.  And I've been \nholding that in.  And this moment, man, it's -- it's not about me.  \nNobody should care about me.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm fine.  I'm fine.  It's \nabout all of us, right?  It's about all of the people that -- that we love.  \nYou know, some members of my family -- well, members of my \nfamily that are inside did do something wrong.  They did, right?  They \ndid.  I want them protected just a long -- just as alongside everyone \nelse that -- that -- as well, that -- all the people that are not members of \nmy family.  There's been stories of other folks.  And, you know, I was \nable to absorb it.  And the -- the fact that in those moments I wasn't \ncrying, I think I surprised myself.  \nI'm gonna end by just saying when Speaker Heastie \nbecame Speaker, the first words he said was that reforming the \nCriminal Justice System will be the focus of his speakership.  And that \nhad me.  I was all in.  I had the opportunity to go back to the City \nCouncil, a place I love, place I started my professional career.  But I \nrealized that if I went back to the City Council, I couldn't help him \ncarry out his mission.  Now, when that happened, I had no idea I \nwould ever become the Chair of Corrections.  I just was happy to have \na vote in the Legislature that impacted that.  So, when all of you guys \ndo this stuff, yeah, it matters.  Yeah, I may be good at hiding emotion \nmost times, but I'm like everybody else, I'm human, too.  I'm a person, \ntoo.  So to say that and I see the Leader coming over.  I guess it's -- \nI'm not sure if it's for moral support or to say to wrap it up, but -- \nMRS.

We all fall short of the \nglory of God, but the one thing that God affords us is forgiveness and \nwe have to learn to correct without canceling.  And with that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n284correction comes a level of dignity, humanity and respect.  \nIn visiting prisons, I realized that some of the \nprisoners are afraid to even report certain things because there's \nretaliation of continuous violations.  They are brutalized and asked to \nhide their bruises.  When they report these things, they are violated \neven more.  It's like the police policing the police.  If they go to the \ncommissioner, commissioner calls over to the location.  If they call \nout and report it to OSI, OSI comes and investigates in front of the \nvery people that are actually committing these egregious acts.  So, this \ndoes not address all of the major concerns that we need to have \noversight on the many egregious acts that are -- are -- are -- are \nimplemented on those individuals, but it is a beginning, it's a start and \nwe live to fight another day for additional things.  \nSo, with that, again, I support this piece of legislation.  \nI commend this Body for working on it collectively and I vote in the \naffirmative for this bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMs. Lucas in the affirmative. \nMs. Romero to explain her vote. \nMS. ROMERO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nBefore I was elected to the New York State Assembly, I was a public \ndefender.  And myself and others involved in the criminal legal \nsystem as attorneys, advocates, or formerly incarcerated individuals, \nwe are aware of the darkness, the sludge, the nasty, the intensity, the \npain and the literal bloodshed that exists within prisons in our State.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n285Well, there are inevitably people like my mother and \nfather, both lifelong DOCCS employees.  Not COs, but my father \nretired with Parole and my mom eventually retired as a Director of \nCorrections with Mental Health, people that are good and loved their \njob.  While there are people that do love their job within DOCCS, \nthere are people that are ugly within the DOCCS system and the \nlynching of Robert Brooks exposed this ugliness.  And it exposed this \nugliness in our prison system for so many people.  And -- and it is for \nthat reason that we must identify this and eliminate it.  It's my sincere \nhope that this omnibus bill addresses this and like I said, eliminates \nthis ugliness within the DOCCS system.  \nWhile I join some of my colleagues in aching for \nother criminal justice reform in this Session, I do thank the Speaker \nand the sponsor for putting something forward.  I do hope it inevitably \nwill do some good for thousands of New Yorkers that need it.\nI will be voting yes, but I do not forget that the fight \nis not over and that I look forward to working with my colleagues and \nthe input of people that I know love the system, like my parents and \nmy fellow attornies and currently and formally incarcerated \nindividuals.  Just like my eloquent colleague in the back row that has \nbeen breaking barriers.  I vote yes and look forward to the future fight.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Romero in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Epstein to explain his vote. \nMR.

I want to thank the sponsor, I want to thank the \nSpeaker for moving this package forward.  One of the bills in this \npackage, reporting of the death of an incarcerated person we've been \nworking on for three years and we've talked to so many families and \nhave been to so many facilities and, you know, families keep saying, \nwe don't know what's happening to our loved ones.  We didn't know \nwhen they passed away, we got no information for day, after day , after \nday.  And part of this package is allowing families some closure.  But \nwhat really this whole package is about is trying to bring transparency \nand accountability to our corrections system.  And if we really believe \nin corrections, this is an opportunity we have, right now, in this \nmoment, to do that.  The -- the murder of Robert Brooks, as everyone \nkeeps saying, really put a spotlight on what's going on in corrections.  \nWe see it everyday when we talk to people who are incarcerated.  We \nvisit prisons, we hear from them directly.  We hear the fear, the \nanxiety and the risk.  It is our responsibility to deal it with the life and \nhealth of New Yorkers whether they're behind the wall, or not.  And \nthis is our opportunity to continue to move forward.  There were some \nthings that we couldn't get in this package and I know with the work \nof this Body, we will get there some day soon.  But this is an \nimportant first step and I'm voting in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Epstein in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Maher to explain his vote.\nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n287explain my vote.  At the beginning of this year, I did not believe and \nunderstand that the majority of my time would be monopolized on this \nissue and with the work action that took place, having four prisons in \nmy district and two right next to my district where a majority of the \nfolks that work live, it was all encompassing.  And I really appreciate \nthe sponsor's emotion, I take it to heart, because I feel that same \nemotion.  And when we advocate for correction officers, we are not \nadvocating for the murder of Robert Brooks, murderers.  We're not.  I \nchoose to see incarcerated individuals and view the majority of those \nfolks as individuals that want to reintegrate back in to society and \nbecome productive members of society.  When I look at our correction \nofficers, I choose to view a majority of them as the folks that are \nhelping save lives in prison.  We can't simply judge either side for \ntheir worst and we need to overcome that.  All of us, together.  \nThe number one issue facing our prisons is the \nstaffing crisis.  The number one recruiter for correction officers are \ncorrection officers and they're not encouraging anyone to work.  They \nneed to have a seat at the table.  We all have to acknowledge it, \nbecause what's best for our correction officers is also going to be, \neventually, what's best for those that are incarcerated.  We can't have \nthe programing, we can't have the recreation, until staffing levels \nreach a certain level and they won't until this conversation is \ncompleted in a true, bipartisan way, with everyone at the table talking \nto each other and with each other and not past each other.  \nI am very much encouraged by the sponsor, by \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n288several of my colleagues on the other -- other side of the aisle to \nhopefully continue that conversation -- \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nMaher.  How do you vote?\nMR. MAHER:  -- and I vote in the negative, but with \nhope --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Maher in the \nnegative. \nMs. Solages.  \nMS. SOLAGES:  To explain my vote.  Our justice \nsystem rests on the idea that even when someone is incarcerated, the \nState is still responsibile for upholding order and treating every person \nwith basic human dignity.  It is a serious duty.  So, when a public \nservant, someone who took an oath to uphold the duty, takes a life, it \nis not a tragedy, it's a breach of trust.  The death of Robert Brooks and \nthe death of Messiah Nantwi raised serious questions about how we \noversee our correctional institution and how we hold our own systems \naccountable.  We can't stop at oversight.  True public safety includes \naccountability, structure and the opportunity for people to change.  A \nsystem that punishes endlessly without a path to redemption, is not \none that reflects our values here in New York State.\nI want to thank Speaker Heastie for his response -- \nhis responsiveness.  I also want to extend my gratitude to the Chair of \nboth correctional committees, in both the Assembly and the Senate, \nfor truly taking their passion and their persistence and getting this on \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n289the bus together.  And I especially want to thank my colleagues in the \nBlack, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus for \nrefusing to look away.  Through your strength and your unwavering \nfocus, we are turning loss into action and outrage into accountability, \nbut it -- but our fight isn't over.  Let's carry forward the names of \nRobert and Messiah, not as headlines, but as a call to action.  Let their \nmemories be the reason why we refuse to accept the unacceptable.\nAnd with that, I vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Solages in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Hyndman to explain her vote. \nMS. HYNDMAN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nallowing me to explain my vote.  Individual -- individually in this \nBody, we have had to bury loved ones.  Whether it be children, \nparents, spouses, friends, neighbors and constituents.  I don't believe \nany of us can say we saw a loved one beaten to death on camera for \nthe world to see as the father did, Mr. Robert Brooks, who watched \nhis son die.  His death isn't in vain, it spurred this package.  And I \nwant to thank the Speaker and the sponsor of this legislation that \nthrough these works, this bill will be signed by the Governor and be \nbrought into law and all of the other bills that we need to get passed in \nthis House to make sure that this -- that this doesn't happen again.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.

BURKE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nListening to the debate is what I was going to make my decision on \nand what I realized is, we -- I've already known, but it's more clear \nnow than it ever has been to me, we have a deeply, deeply broken \nsystem.  The State is failing a lot of people and it pits people against \neach other.  I've heard incredibly dehumanizing language and rhetoric.  \nI've heard people refer to COs as monsters and I've heard other people \nrefer to incarcerated individuals as animals.  And when the debate \ngoes down to monsters versus animals, everyone loses.  It's going to \nresult in violence and dehumanization all of the time.  So, being \nthoughtful and conscious of how we speak about people and focus on \nfixing systems, but when -- from my point of view, I've had members \nof my family who are incarcerated and I have members of my family \nwho are COs.  My brother-in-law was stabbed at seven times and \nfortunately he had a stab vest on.  He's one of the most mild-mannered \npeople you'll ever meet, he's not a monster.  So just casting all of these \npeople in that light is dangerous.  We do not need a powder keg in our \n-- in our prison system, we need to fix broken systems.  I think that \nthat is -- this is an honest effort towards doing that and I look forward \nto continuing that effort. \nThank you, Madam Speaker.  I vote in the \naffirmative.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Burke in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n291affirmative.\nMs. Levenberg to explain her vote.  \nMS. LEVENBERG:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, to \nexplain my vote in light of the horrific murder of Robert Brooks at the \nhands of correction officers, which the world witnessed, the unlawful \nwildcat strike and the inhumane treatment of incarcerated individuals.  \nI want to thank the sponsor and the Speaker for putting forth this \nomnibus bill, which is one step in the direction of making our \nfacilities safer.  It works to ensure camera, blind spots, increases \ntransparency, extends statutes of limitations, increases oversight and \namends other laws to achieve the goal of safer spaces for all.  \nHowever, I believe we need to do much more to reduce our prison \npopulation and we have solutions at our fingertips.  This omnibus bill \nis addressing aspects of safety, but essentially aside from acting a \ndeterrent, these actions all follow when an incident has already \ntranspired.  What it doesn't do is change the culture inside our walls.  \nIt doesn't work to change attitudes, it does not incentivize respect for \nhuman beings, whether they'd be incarcerated individuals or \noverworked COS.  To do so we need to make a big dent in reducing \nthe population, reinstating effective programs that significantly reduce \nrecidivism and help individuals rehabilitate and acknowledge that 95 \npercent of incarcerated individuals will be released.  If we truly focus \non rehabilitation and on second looks and on second chances, we will \nsee change.  We need to come back to pass Second Look and Earned \nTime, the Marvin Mayfield Act, Elder Parole and Fair and Timely \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n292Parole, then we will start to see significant systemic change.\nMadam Speaker, I vote in the affirmative.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Levenberg in \nthe affirmative.\nMr. Anderson to explain his vote.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I'm \ngoing to take a moment to thank my colleague from the 68th \nAssembly District for bringing his valued experience being in New \nYork State's carceral system.  May none of my colleagues here in this \nChamber have that lived experience and share it, but learn from it so \nwe can actively work to improve our incarceration system and our \ncorrection system here in the State of New York.  I thank the sponsor \nfor his hard work and all of my colleagues who have legislation in this \npackage.  I think that it's critical that as legislators in this Chamber, \nthat we all take time to visit a correctional facility across this State and \nsee some of the things that I've had an opportunity to see over the last \nfour years, five years here in this Chamber, visiting facilities.  The \nreality of the situation is is that last year a man was lynched and his \nlife was taken away from him due to the inadequacies of our criminal \n-- criminal justice system.  And I think it's important that in this \nmoment, that in this omnibus bill that we're working to pass today, \nthat we say that his life matter.  And we say that the lives of the other \n46 plus individuals who were killed, or lost their lives, in our prison \nfacilities here in the State of New York, that their lives matter.\nThis bill represents transparency, but it doesn't \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n293represent the things that we completely need to reform this system, \nlike Elder Timely Parole, (indiscernible) and a bunch of other critical \nlegislation, but it's certainly a step in the right -- right direction.\nSo, Madam Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to \nspeak on this bill and I withdraw my request and vote in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Anderson in \nthe affirmative.  \nMr. Otis to explain his vote.\nMR. OTIS:  Thank you.  The murder of Robert \nBrooks opened the eyes to all New Yorkers and to both Houses of the \nLegislature about what's going on in our prison system.  You know, \nit's too easy to say, the prison system is over there, we're forgetting \nabout what's going on.  That's sort of the tendency in society and it's a \nbig mistake.  It's a dangerous mistake.  \nSo, Robert Brooks died, was murdered, but what \nwe've also learned is how many other people died behind prison walls.  \nShocking.  Terrible.  As has been mentioned, most people are coming \nout.  And so, what are we doing to improve education, improve job \ntraining, improve the safety of the institution for those that are \nincarcerated, for those that work there, so that this can be an \nexperience that people can leave and not come back.  That people can \ngo on with their lives in a positive way.  We have a start with this bill.  \nThis bill is really about a little more safety, a little bit more \naccountability; that's not enough.  We really have to revisit our whole \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n294correctional system and make the resources available for it to be a safe \nplace.  To be a place where people can benefit from the experience \nand get out and change their lives.  We have a long way to go.  This is \na very good start.  Congratulations to the Chair of the committee, Mr. \nDilan, to the Speaker.  \nThe last thing I'll say is, in the budget hearing, we \nheard from -- heard moving testimony from Robert Brooks' father and \nI -- I -- just to be there and to -- to sense the loss in -- in this horrible \nsituation, we have to redouble our efforts to make sure, as has been \nmentioned by others, that his life is not lost in vain and that we change \nthe direction of this prison system in this State as quickly as possible.  \nI vote aye. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Otis in the \naffirmative. \nMs. Kelles to explain her vote.\nMS. KELLES:  Something that I -- I keep thinking \nabout over and over and over again is the fact that we had six men that \nwere directly involved in the brutal murder that we all saw, that the \nworld saw, of Robert Brooks.  There were 15 people who were \ninvolved in the brutal murder of Messiah Nantwi and every single one \nof them, except for one, is still walking free.  And I think it's really \nimportant for all of us to imagine what it must be like to be the family \nmembers knowing that the world viewed those videos and all of those \npeople are still free, because that would not be the case if they were \nBlack or Brown people.  They would be in prison.  I think that's really \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n295important because what we saw in those videos is that abuse is \nhappening and no one can deny it at this point. \nDoes this package go far enough?  No, absolutely.  \nFor those -- those families?  No, it does not.  It does address, it is a \nstart, it does address accountability.  And I want to thank the sponsor \nfor having the courage to show humanity and show emotions, because \nthere are very few men that are willing to do what you just did and I \nwant to thank you and honor you for that.  And you also brought up \nthe Earned Time Act that I sponsor and I just want to thank you for \nacknowledging.  We might not have all the details worked out, but we \nwill get there and I will keep fighting with you to make sure that \nhappens, because we know that it reduces violence against corrections \nofficers.  We know that it reduces violence between those \nincarcerated.  We know that it reduces recidivism rates.  We know \nthat it builds inspiration, that it brings families back together.  We \nknow that it's good for literally everybody and there are more \nRepublican states in this country that use it way more than we do.  \nWe're behind and we need to catch up, because it's the right thing to \ndo.  To build -- to build workforce development, education and send \npeople back into communities knowing that we truly, truly created a \ncorrection of -- a system of corrections and not a system of \npunishment, which is too often what it is now.  That we hear from our \ncolleague that is formally incarcerated.  We hear that too often.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Ms. \nKelles.  How do you vote?\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n296MS. KELLES:  So I stand in the affirmative and I \nvote yes on this bill.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Kelles in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Gandolfo to explain his vote. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I'll \nbe voting no on this bill, but that's not because there's nothing good in \nit.  I won't reiterate all the reasons, some of my colleagues have laid \nthose out pretty well.  But one issue as it pertains to this bill is the \nexpansion of the Commission on Correction, but not including \nsomeone who's truly looking out for the interest of the COs.  And that \ndoesn't have to be an ad -- in an adversarial manner, but someone who \ncan make recommendations on how to improve safety for them \nbecause at the end of the day, the COs are also tasked with keeping \nthe incarcerated safe and if they are overworked and understaffed, I \ndon't think we will truly ever get to the place we want to be in terms \nof our prison conditions.  If -- I think the Governor would be well- \nserved to send a chapter amendment back to this House, adding a \nrepresentative for the COs on the Commission on Corrections, I think \nthat will pave the way to truly getting where we need to be and fixing \nthe issues within our prisons.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gandolfo in the \nnegative.\nMs. Shimsky to explain her vote.  \nMS. SHIMSKY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  We \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n297are nowhere as a society without the rule of law and the acid test of \nthe rule of law is how we treat people when we incarcerate them.  \nWhat many of us knew before the murder of Roberts Brooks and what \neveryone else learned thereafter, is that the failure of our State \ncorrections system is so close to total that our facilities are really this \ngenerations Willowbrook.  \nThis omnibus package is a great start, but what really \ncounts is what we're going to do in the next several years.  What we \nare going to do with all of the information we've gleaned from the \nreformed packages tonight.  I am thankful that Mr. Dilan is going to \nbe leading the charge on that.  And in that spirit, Madam Chair, I vote \nin the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Shimsky in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Zaccaro to explain his vote.\nMR. ZACCARO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nToday we stand at a pivotal moment in pursuit of justice and reform \nwithin our correctional system.  And before us is a comprehensive \npackage that not only seeks to enhance accountability and \ntransparency in our correctional facilities, but also addresses the \nurgent need for reform.  Reform that has been long overdue.  For too \nlong, our prisons have been places where justice is overshadowed by \nneglect and systematic failures and recent tragedies that have \nunderscored this reality, reminding us of our moral obligation to act.  \nIn the heartbreaking murder of Robert Brooks at the hands of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n298correctional officers is a stark reminder of that urgent need for reform.  \nHis story is not just one of loss, it is a call to action.  A demand for a \nsystem that prioritizes safety, dignity and humanity, both for those \nwho are incarcerated and for the dedicated officers who serve.  Let us \nremind that while this package represents a critical starting point, it is \nnot the finish line.  It is where we must continue to push for additional \nreforms, for we owe it to those who have suffered in silence and to the \nfamilies who have lost loved ones to a system that has repeatedly \nfailed them.  \nAnd in closing, I'd like to leave you with the words of \nthe author and activist, Audre Lorde, who said, \"It is not our \ndifferences that divide us.  It is our inability to recognize, accept and \ncelebrate those differences.\"  So, let us not allow our differences and \nperspective on justice and reform to divide us.  Instead, let's us -- let it \nunite us in our commitment to address these injustices within our \nprisons and champion the reforms that are so desperately needed.  \nAnd with that, I proudly vote in the affirmative.  \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Zaccaro in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Gibbs to explain his vote. \nMR. GIBBS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I stand \nhere conflicted.  I'm a hard negative on the bill.  I believe that it \ndoesn't do enough and in expediency to put out a fire, we put together \na package to address certain things, but not the most serious of the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n299correctional facilities.  \nI want to go on the record and say that all \ncorrectional officers aren't bad, but every correctional officer isn't \nBilly Jones.  Just like every incarcerated individual isn't Eddie Gibbs.  \nWe have to communicate better and listen to one another and respect \none another during that conversation.  But, more importantly, there are \npeople in prison who are suffering.  Everyone in prison isn't a \nmurderer, everyone in prison isn't pedophile or a rapist.  Some of them \nhave mental health issues, some have drug additions [sic] but yet, they \nare suffering in the walls and fences by abuse of correction officers.  I \nshared with you guys that five of them stomped on me for 25 minutes.  \nIt was horrible.  I know the fear.  When I walk inside these facilities, I \nsee these young men and these women afraid.  This package has \nsimply just put out a fire, it doesn't address that.\nSo, I'm a -- I'm a negative on the vote.  I think we're \ngonna do better next year.  I remain hopeful.  I pray a lot.  I thank my \ncolleagues on the other side for praying with me.  And we just have to \ndo better.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gibbs in the \nnegative.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes to explain her vote. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you very much, \nMadam Speaker, for the opportunity to explain my vote.  I -- I think \nthis is a start.  I have to be honest, when I first got a glimpse of the \nvideo, I couldn't even watch it.  I had to go -- keep going back in order \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n300to see the whole thing, because I don't watch scary movies either and I \ndon't watch things when people are being hurt and bludgeoned.  I just \ndon't watch that sort of thing even on movies.  So I had a hard time \nwatching that.  But I have family that work in corrections and so I \ncalled them up.  And was like, what -- what -- what is -- what is this \nabout?  What is this going on?  And yes, they acknowledge that there \nis -- that does happen sometimes, but it doesn't happen all the time.  \nAnd so, one of my cousins, she sent me a letter from one of her \ncolleagues who had just resigned because of the conditions that he had \nto work under, and in his words in the letter that he sent to me he said, \n\"Not every correction officer is a bad person, just as not every -- just \nas not every officer works to their -- but every officer does not work to \ntheir limits.  It is easy to generalize, but the reality is more \ncomplicated.  He worked -- I worked in corrections for seven years.  I \nwitnessed the bad and I spoke up.  I also saw the good and I spoke up.  \nThe truth is is that correctional systems affects everyone, including \nofficers, the incarcerated individuals and their families.\"  This young \nman decided to retire, or to resign, rather than keep working in a \nsituation like this.  That says that this is a start in this legislation, but \nwe -- we got to fix this.  We have to figure out how to fix it that \nengages everybody.  So, I will say that the only thing that should be \ndifferent in this beginning legislation is that there should be somebody \nwho is either an -- a former correction officer, or a current correction \nofficer who sits at the table to come up with how we fix this problem.  \nAnd I vote in the affirmative. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n301ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mrs. \nPeoples-Stokes in the affirmative.\nAre there any other votes?

An act \nto amend the General Business Law, in relation to the training and use \nof artificial intelligence frontier models.   \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Mr. \nBores, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is\nadvanced. \nAn explanation has been requested.\nMr. Bores. \nMR. BORES:  This bipartisan bill, which earlier \ntoday passed the Senate with support from every Minority party \nmember, is focused on keeping us secure from the most extreme risks \nfrom advanced AI development.  AI experts in industry themselves \nhave said that we need urgent regulation within the next ten months.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n302This bill, which only applies to the largest companies and developers, \nfocuses on holding them to commitments on safety they've already \nmade.  In particular, every company that this would likely apply to \ntoday, has already committed to quote, \"Give significant attention to \nbiochemical and radiological risks, such as the ways in which systems \ncan lower barriers to entry for weapons development and to publicly \ndisclosing their red teaming and safety procedures in their \ntransparency reports.\"  As such, this bill requires that those that spend \n$100 million, or more, on compute costs for training models, have a \nsafety plan and disclose critical safety incidents.  And because this bill \nestablishes light-weight guardrails that keep New Yorkers safe, it's \nsupported by 84 percent of New Yorkers across party and hopefully \nall of you. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. \nBlumencranz.  \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Thank you.  Will the \nsponsor yield for some questions, please?\nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. BORES:  I will.\nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  The sponsor \nyields. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So, we did discuss this in \nCommittee, but it seems that the bill's changed a little bit from there, \nso a few of the questions might seem a little bit familiar.  As far as the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n303changes from the A- to the B-print, many of the provisions \nsurrounding the sections relating to employees, et cetera, have \nchanged, correct, or have been removed altogether? \nMR. BORES:  Correct. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Also, any -- anything \nsimilar or resembling a private right to [sic] action is also removed, \ncorrect?  \nMR. BORES:  I would argue there was none \nestablished in the original as well, but this one we explicitly put in a \nclause that no --\nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Yes.\nMR. BORES: -- private right of action is created. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Nothing in this article shall \nbe construed to establish a private right [sic] to action.  So you're \npretty crystal clear there, correct?  \nMR. BORES:  I think so, yes. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  But there is -- the Attorney \nGeneral may still bring a civil action in the new version as well?  \nMR. BORES:  Correct.  Right.  It is saying it is not \ncreating a new private right of action.  All of the enforcement is done \nby the Attorney General, and any separate question about liability is \nhandled in common law already before or after this bill. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So this bill has made its \nrounds in a few State Legislatures, California in particular where it \npassed and had been vetoed.  What are the most fundamental \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n304differences between this version and the version that didn't quite make \nit past the Governor's desk in California?  \nMR. BORES:  Yeah, this is a very different bill than \nthe one in California.  There are a number of things we've changed.  \nThere's obviously extraneous provisions like they were creating their \nown version of Empire AI, and they were also doing Know Your \nCustomer on Cloud providers.  We've taken all of that out.  But on the \nmeat of the bill, there's a number of differences.  First is we put in the \ndefinition of a large developer, so it only applies once you spend 100 \nmillion or more.  The California one could include people that spent \nonly 10 million.  We also apply it at the company level, not the model \nlevel, so they don't need to make 100 safety plans if they have 100 \nmodels.  They can have one and update it yearly.  It's much simpler \nfor compliance purposes.  There's no reference to any kill switch, \nwhich was a big fear that many people talked about.  And different \nversions of the California one over time established a new office or \ndid in this one, does not establish any government office to -- to any \nnew government office.  And I think the biggest difference now in the \nB-print is that there are no audits in this bill at all.  But there was a lot \nmore opposition earlier in Session, and most of that was focused on \nthe audits themselves. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So no outside third-party \naudits at all.  \nMR. BORES:  No outside third-party audits in this \nbill. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n305MR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Let's go through some of \nthe definitions, then.  You just talked about the frontier model.  You \nmake specific mention also within your definition of \"critical harm.\" \nMR. BORES:  Yes. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  But there is a definition in \nthere that I did have a question about.  You talk about unreasonable \nrisk of critical harm.  How do you define \"unreasonable risk\"?  I \ncouldn't find it in the bill. \nMR. BORES:  So, a reasonableness standard is one \nthat's been part of common law juris prudence for centuries, and is \napplied in a lot of cases.  We do have a very specific definition of \ncritical harm which is in the bill, as you --  \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Very specific.  \nMR. BORES:  Yes.  \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So, I mean, almost so much \nso that I -- I was curious in some situations because you do include \ncritical harm means death or serious injury of 100 or more people or at \nleast $1 billion in damages to rights, money or property, et cetera.  If a \nsystem that is -- would qualify under this as a large-scale Frontier \nmodel were to commit a horrible crime like take down a plane.  There \nwere 87 passengers.  They would not -- that would not be considered a \ncritical harm, and thus, they -- you know, how would that affect them \nversus maybe a plane that went down with 110 people?  \nMR. BORES:  So -- so common law juris prudence, \nright, would already handle any questions on after-the-fact liability. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n306What this is saying is trying to be specific to the most extreme cases \nare those the ones that developers need to plan for, or to plan against, I \nshould say, and develop tests in order to prevent.  We had to draw the \nline somewhere.  What we are trying to make clear is that we're really \ntalking about the very extreme versions.  We're not saying they need \nto plan for very potential use of their models. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So it's not arbitrary, but it's \na little arbitrary. \nMR. BORES:  Well, any time you choose any \nnumber, right, you're making a choice.  So yes, we've made a choice \non a specific number here, but it is meant to point to the extreme \ncases. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Okay.  \nMy next question is related to the -- the \nimplementation of it on the knowledge distillation models, the 5 \nmillion threshold.  Could you explain what sort of company would be \ncaptured in that definition?  Because that seems to be pretty \ntroublesome for the smaller businesses out there; for the start-ups out \nthere, for those who might not be able to pay the massive penalty who \nmight now be captured. \nMR. BORES:  So, the knowledge distillation clause \nis meant to ensure that we are covering risks from developers that do \nthe very specific process of knowledge distillation, which I'm happy to \ngo into if you'd like, that can create a smaller model from a bigger \nFrontier model that has similar capabilities.  But very important in this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n307bill is that if you do that once, you do that for a $5 million model, you \nare not covered in this bill.  The only time this bill applies is when you \nhave spent an aggregate $100 million directly on computes, directly \non the final training run of models.  So it will not affect smaller \ncompanies. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Who qualifies the direct \ncompute?  I think about DEPS, right, DEPS came out with those --\nMR. BORES:  Yep.\nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  -- amazing headline that \nthey built it with no money at all.  But the PLA, the Chinese \ngovernment, private investment, all behind that.  A small number was \na much larger number.  So because they said they did it for 10 million, \nwould they be considered Frontier?  Who makes that qualification that \nthey are a Frontier model or not?  I mean, not every company is \ndomiciled in the U.S.  Are we taking their word for it?  \nMR. BORES:  So with DeepSeek in particular, the \nmodel that really caught fire and made news was -- cost over 5 million \nto train, was made from knowledge distillation, but it wasn't made \nfrom knowledge distillation of a Frontier model.  It was trained on 01 \nfrom OpenAI, which would not meet the first definition of being 1026.  \nSo it wouldn't apply in that case.  But similar cases in the future that \nwould be trained off of a Frontier model would be included in this \nbill. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So once -- so a start-up in \nNew York would be captured in this regulation but Chinese, you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n308know, government-sanctioned models that are being used in New \nYork would not be captured? \nMR. BORES:  Any Frontier model with a nexus to \nNew York -- and it's specifically defined in the bill as being deployed \nwholly or partly in the State of New York -- would be covered.  And \nso insofar as DeepSeek is on the App Store, it's available in the State \nof New York, would actually capture a future version of DeepSeek if \nit met the other criteria for being a Frontier model. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  You say a future version.  \nSo the current model doesn't qualify, but if there's a -- there's a \ncontinuous movement of when you may qualify if you continue to \nspend money on the creation of a next generation or -- a next \ngeneration?  \nMR. BORES:  There are -- there are very few models \nthat are confirmed to have the 1026 FLOPs and 100 million in training.  \nSo this is -- the bill mostly focused on the models that are coming, not \nthe ones that we're all familiar with and already working on. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Do you not see a world in \nwhich this facilitates, especially if this model becomes a multistate \nwhere we're moving companies or sort of maybe accidentally urging \nthem to move into a black box and out of an open source because now \nthey don't want to comply and then can do so without necessarily \nbeing a open source version of one of these models?  \nMR. BORES:  I -- I don't think so.  This bill is \ncompatible with Open Source.  The companies themselves have to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n309design their own safety plan, and they can continue to produce these \nopen-weight models after this bill or before it.  I'll note that what came \nin as an opposition memo said that they estimated that this would \nrequire one full-time employee to comply with.  One full-time \nemployee for Meta or for Google is not gonna cause them to move. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  You're saying that you don't \nsee a future in which the capture for, let's say, maybe not the Frontier \nmodel, which I'm up for debate as well, but the knowledge distillation \nthreshold, there are only a few companies that are performing these at \na -- at a basis of 5 million more than once?  \nMR. BORES:  Well, there's only a few companies \nthat would get up to that 100 million spent, yes. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Okay.  And your -- it's, I \nguess, predictive that you'll start capturing every new Frontier model \nby hitting this number?  \nMR. BORES:  I actually -- well, it's sort of circular \nbecause we're defining the Frontier model.  But to take the question \nmore expansively, I think in many ways this is underinclusive.  And \nI've gotten that feedback from industry itself, actually as recently as a \nfew hours ago, that they think the definition is in some case too \nlimited in Frontier models.  But I did really want to focus on the most \nextreme risks and -- and take a, again, light-touch approach to what \nwe're regulating here. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Okay.  \nLet's talk about the time period of disclosure.  What \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n310made you land on the 72-hour mark for large developers and learning \nmodels or -- sorry, for incidents, rather?  \nMR. BORES:  The 72 hours is based on other \nprovisions in New York where we have a similar time frame, I think, \naround cyber disclosure, more nuclear disclosure.  But we were very \nintentional in limiting what has to be reported within those 72 hours.  \nIt's simply that an incident occurred, which of the enumerated types it \nwas, and we put in the bill a short description of what happened.  So \nwe do not require reams and reams of paper reporting.  We just want \nnotice that something occurred.  With how powerful this technology \nis, something could spin out of control quickly so we think it's \nimportant to hear about it fast. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  When we talk about the \nviolations, the civil penalties, et cetera, you're -- you're pretty -- pretty \nnarrow in who qualifies somewhat.  But -- but the article shall only \napply to Frontier models that are developed, deployed and operating \nin part or in whole in New York State.  Is there any definition to what \nlevel of participation the New York State marketplace -- could they be \nselling a product if it's a product that is (indiscernible) now, but selling \nsomething later, would they qualify or just simply operating in New \nYork?  Where does that qualification level -- \nMR. BORES:  Certainly -- certainly, operating and \ndeveloped in I think are fairly clear, and deployed is defined in the bill \nitself as being used or being made available to a third-party for them \nto use. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n311MR. BLUMENCRANZ:  When it comes to the \nsection relating to the unredacted copy of the policy, so you had \nenumerated in this new iteration of the bill what can and can't be \nredacted as far as trade secrets, et cetera, some of the main concerns \npreviously.  In the unredacted copy, who has the access to that and \nwhere and how is it potentially secure within the publication under \nthis piece of legislation? \nMR. BORES:  Yeah, this was feedback that we got \nfrom the industry quite a bit, that they didn't want to trust government \nagencies with an unredacted copy.  Now, I think that severely \nunderestimates the skill and professionalism of, say, the Department \nof -- of (indiscernible) here in New York or -- or the OAG.  But we \nwanted to take that under advisement, so we said that all we have to \ndo is grant access to it.  So you could be viewing it virtually, right, \nthat needs to be shared.  But you never need to send the unredacted \ncopy, it never needs to be stored on a government server. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  What mechanisms in the \nbill exist to ensure that we're not locking ourselves into a static \nframework that becomes obsolete over time when implemented?  \nWe're often seeing legislation related to this topic come in and out of \nthis House and other state legislatures that by the next session may not \nnecessarily be the language you or I would have chosen.  How does \nthis bill and the language try and prevent that -- that issue here?  \nMR. BORES:  I mean, we've had a lot of \nconversations with industry and -- and with activists and thinking \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n312about how to set it up to be as future-proof as it can be.  AI models \nwill also continue to develop.  Thankfully, as far as I know, the New \nYork State Legislature does plan to be in Session in 2026, so if we \nneed to update it I look forward to doing that. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So why not place maybe \nmore of a sandboxing or a sunset provision or something that allows \nthe Legislature to work and allow for the policy to evolve instead of \nbeing so sweeping with such punitive regulation here?  Why not \ncreate -- or would you support an amendment that would maybe \nsunset the bill if no changes are needed or if we feel like it becomes \nantiquated over time? \nMR. BORES:  In -- in other bills, as you know, I -- \nI've put sunsets in, specifically when we're talking about a specific \ntechnical standard that might change over time.  But this is talking \nabout largely the company policies and processes.  And, again, they're \nthings that all of these companies have committed to already, and so I \ndidn't see a need to have that sunset. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So, oftentimes when we're \ntalking about these sort of frameworks -- and I know people, everyone \nfrom on the left to the right, Nancy Pelosi in the California argument \nherself said that she wasn't a fan of frameworks like this one, but are \nmore inclined to focus on either a Federal regulation or see states take \na more risk-based, use case-specific framework that targets AI \napplications where they find that they may be most malicious to the \npublic.  Why take this sweeping action and not the scalpel or a more \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n313narrowed approach that makes more sense with both industry and the \nmarketplace?  \nMR. BORES:  I -- I'd have a few things there.  One \nwould be that I don't think this is taking a -- a wide approach.  It's \nactually, as you've seen, very narrowly-tailored to the largest risks, the \nlargest companies, and only a few specific actions they've already \ncommitted to.  And I think the 1047 opposition, that was a very \ndifferent bill that had audits in it, that had all the different things that \nwe talked about.  So I wouldn't describe those two things as similar or \nthat anyone's thoughts on the first should -- should detail their \nthoughts on the latter.  We were very -- we listened to all of that \nfeedback and incorporated much of it. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  But I'd like to say that I \nappreciate the fact that unlike Connecticut, say, which didn't \nnecessarily listen a lot on feedback and faced the same adversity that \nCalifornia did, there have been some significant changes here which I \ndo want to say I appreciate. \nWould it make -- if we're not -- if we're serious about \nAI safety, then how does this bill protect against the foreign \nadversaries that are becoming, you know, a bigger factor in this \nconversation?  We're -- we kind of transcend State lines with an issue \nthis big with so many national security implications.  Do you think \nthat this hinders innovation in New York if there's a framework here \nthat's exclusive to here, that these companies may just go overseas?  \nAnd if they don't like many crypto and financial assets that just simply \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n314aren't available in New York, they would just leave themselves out of \nthe New York market until they figure out how to correctly regulate \nthose?\nMR. BORES:  I -- I do not think that these American \ncompanies that you're talking about or even foreign companies will \nwant to leave the New York market and all of our consumers here.  \nEvery time we do any type of regulation, people threaten to leave the \nState.  Again, even the opposition is saying this would require one \nfull-time employee to comply with.  So I don't think that's causing \nanyone to leave.  But I would add to that that China actually regulates \ntheir AI far more than we do here in the United States and far more \nthan anything that has been proposed.  I mean, the CCP has really \ntight screws on what any model can say and really digs into how all of \nit is developed.  So regulation is not gonna be the reason there's a \ndifference between -- between our countries in development.  But the \nthreats from foreign -- foreign threats is actually one of the motivating \nfactors of a specific clause in this bill of 12(b), where we ask for \nreasonable administrative, technical and physical cybersecurity \nprotections for Frontier models within the large developer's control \nthat if successfully implemented appropriately reduced the risk of \nunauthorized access to or misuse of the Frontier model, including by \nsophisticated actors.  We are specifically saying one of the biggest \nthreats to American innovation and development of AI is the model \nweights being stolen or the details of models being stolen by foreign \nadversaries, and this is requiring our companies to take that threat \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n315seriously. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  How do you speak to many \nof the questions we've seen from individuals in the industry and the \nnon-profit AI space, do still have serious concerns about the \ndownstream liability that exists, specifically relating to the knowledge \ndistillation models, the student-teacher models, et cetera, and that -- \nthat threshold of 5 million does make many feel like they may be \ncaptured even though they are not a Frontier model and they're not \nspending 100 million at the moment.  Would they be captured in any \nway, shape or form?  Do you see not -- non-profits having to deal with \nthis regulation, not necessarily just the Metas of the world?  \nMR. BORES:  No.  Because -- well, first of all, \nacademic research is completely exempt --\nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Yes.  I appreciate that \nremoval, too.\nMR. BORES:  And -- and -- but specifically, this only \napplies if you become a large developer.  And a large developer, \nthere's a hard requirement that you have spent $100 million in \ncompute costs in training models.  It's very specifically designed to \nensure that no smaller player, no small non-profit, no start-up, no even \nmedium or pretty large start-up is being captured by this. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  I just have trouble under -- \nI -- yes, I understand we can't be a capture-all while at the same time \ntrying to be hyper-focused on some.  This is a tricky topic to try and \ntarget and pinpoint who we may regulate because the target is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n316constantly moving and the bar is also constantly moving.  But don't \nyou think that this leaves clear and present danger?  And as -- as \ngovernors in the past that have vetoed this have said, have created a \nfalse sense of security or any false sense that we're actually helping to \nmove the needle in security in AI by only specifically targeting these, \nwhere a smaller model that is built to be more harmful can fly under \nthe radar, a black box under the radar?  And yet these individuals who \nare building these models on a large scale in a open source manner \nwill now be punished for doing so by having to create these guardrails \nand publish this information?  \nMR. BORES:  Well, I -- I don't know about what you \nsaid at the end there about -- no one's being punished and no one -- \nthere's no -- this is just --  \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Well, they're -- they're \nfacing specific regulations hyper-targeted to them versus other \ncompanies that are operating privately that just won't have to regulate \n(indiscernible/cross-talk).  \nMR. BORES:  Well, but it's not hyper-targeted at \nopen source or closed source.  It's hyper-targeted at large developers, \nright?  That's -- that's who it's targeted at.  I agree with you that there \nare additional risks out there, and I -- \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Are there -- sorry.  Are \nthere large developers who are not disclosing how much they're \nspending on their model?  \nMR. BORES:  Are there large develop -- yes, now at \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n317-- at the current point there are.  But -- \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  And they would not be \ncaptured? \nMR. BORES:  No, they would -- if you don't disclose \nthe money it's still about having spent the money, right?  And so if you \nwere spending the money, you are covered.  If you tried to hide that \nand tried to not report, then you would be subject to the penalties in \nthis bill.   \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  So -- I'm just trying to \nunderstand, a foreign company who doesn't necessarily have to abide \nby the reporting standards here necessarily in the same way, they \nwould still be regulated in the same fashion even if we don't \nnecessarily know for a fact how much they're spending on -- \nMR. BORES:  If they are making their products \navailable to New Yorkers, yes. \nMR. BLUMENCRANZ:  Okay.  I believe that is the \nend of my questioning for you on this one.  Thank you so much. \nMR. BORES:  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, Mr. \nBlumencranz.\nMr. Maher. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n318MR. BORES:  Of course. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  The sponsor \nyields. \nMR. MAHER:  All right.  So I appreciate you being \navailable to answer some of these questions.  For me, when I think \nabout this conversation and AI in general, it's a learning experience.  I \nam completely open to an education, whether it's from you or anyone \nelse that comes my way.  So I'm hoping this could be a conversational \nand a learning experience. \nSo the more that I learn about AI, the more that we \nlook into what other states are doing.  Some folks that have enacted \ndifferent laws in their states that they're kind of backtracking now and \ntrying to change and encourage others to be careful, which hopefully \nwe're all learning from.  And they basically talked about a couple \nquestions to ask when putting legislation together.  So I'll ask them to \nyou. \nMR. BORES:  Great. \nMR. MAHER:  The first one is, has AI been \nsufficiently defined?  So I would ask you, how would you define AI?  \nMR. BORES:  Well, there is -- there's a definition in \nthe bill, if you're asking the legal definition, and it's the same \ndefinition that we passed earlier in the budget.  So we're making sure \nthere aren't duplicate definitions of artificial intelligence out there.  \nAnd I could give you a more generic one if you'd like, but I would -- I \nwould probably refer to the bill to the specific definition that's there. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n319MR. MAHER:  So, specifically, I would ask, I \nbelieve it's not in the bill, the specific language.  But when we talk \nabout AI specifically, generative AI is something that we probably \ncould capture and talk about more specifically than something more in \ngeneral.  So when we talk about your bill and how it's written, I guess \nmy concern is is it too general?  \nMR. BORES:  So, generative AI I believe we also \ndefined in the budget separately earlier, and so that part I think is \ntaken care of.  The definition in the bill, which I'm happy to read \nbecause it -- it is quite specific, is artificial intelligence means a \nmachine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined \nobjectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions \ninfluencing real or virtual environments, and that uses machine and \nhuman-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments, abstract \nsuch perceptions into models through analysis in an automated \nmanner, and use model inference to formulate options for information \nor action. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  A couple things.  Let's start \nwith machine learning -- machine system analysis.  So just to give you \na hypothetical -- and I -- I know you talked about a couple of different \nlarger businesses and only certain companies being subject to this bill.  \nBut when we talk about things like algorithms and, you know, general \nmachine learning, I think of just regular computer software.  Like, let's \nsay an Excel spreadsheet.  So I know you have liabilities in here and \npenalties in here.  So let's say I'm using an Excel spreadsheet and I ask \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n320it to compute, in alphabetical order, a list of 500 companies, and by \nname -- let's say it's by last name.  It goes from X to Z.  Well, \ntheoretically, you could be discriminating against an Asian population \nor a certain type of population that has those letters that start with that \nalphabet.  Would they have punitive liability?  \nMR. BORES:  No.  First of all, it's --  there's -- again, \nthere's no new PRA as part of this.  Second of all, Excel wouldn't meet \nthe general definition of artificial intelligence to sort algorithms.  It's \nnot something that would meet that.  Third of all, it's certainly not a \nFrontier model.  It's not 1026 FLOPs and spending 100 million all on \nits training.  And fourth, there's no bias or discrimination clauses \nanywhere in this bill.  This is just focused -- the reason it's focused on \nthe largest models and the reason it's focused on the largest companies \nis that we are really pinpointing the extreme potentially bad outcomes \nfrom artificial intelligence development.  That is all this bill is focused \non.  Not bias or discrimination or any of those other problems which \nare real problems and we should tackle, but are the subject of other \nlegislation. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, I appreciate that. \nThe next one I want to get into is, has the proposed \nlegislation adequately identified specific harm?  So when putting this \nlegislation together, can you speak to some specific harms and \nexamples of that and why this leg -- legislation is necessary?  \nMR. BORES:  Yeah.  So -- so this legislation is \nfocused on what we defined as critical harm, which is the AI model \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n321either materially aiding and creating a chemical, biological, \nradiological or nuclear weapon --\nMR. MAHER:  Okay.\nMR. BORES:  -- or committing what would be a \ncrime under the Penal Code with no meaningful human action.  So \nyou give it a quick, short command and it goes off and does a crime.  \nThat's not something you're, like, telling it do to.  And in committing \neither of those actions, materially enabling that -- so if it's just -- \nmatches what you could find on a search engine, it doesn't count.  And \nhas to result in 100 deaths or $1 billion in damages.  It is a really sort \nof specific set of harms that it's focused on. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Thank you for that.\nAnd then my next follow-up to that would be, have \ncurrent legal and regulatory powers failed to address these specific \nharms?  Are there any sort of guidelines out there?  Are there any \nFederal agencies out there that are already around to make sure that \nthese things do not happen?  \nMR. BORES:  Yeah, there's a lot of voluntary \nconversations and voluntary commitments.  And what we are seeing is \ncompanies that have made those commitments now are not necessarily \nliving up to them.  Through this process I've talked to all of the large \ndevelopers, probably many, many times, and I've asked most of them, \nDo you stand by the commitments you made to the White House in \n2023?  Do you stand by the sole commitments?  Do you stand by the \ncommitments that you made at each of these conferences?   And they \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n322all say, Yes.  We have not rescinded any of our commitments , and yet \nthey're not living up to them.  So we have started to -- they have \nacknowledged they need to do it and that they can do it and that they \nwill do it, but they're still not doing it.  So that's why we need some \nbinding legislation. \nMR. MAHER:  Who's \"they\"? \nMR. BORES:  I don't know that I wanna be picking \non any of the specific ones, but you -- you know the large AI \ndevelopers. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  Appreciate that.  All right.\nI know there were some edits to this bill.  Was audits \nedited out?  \nMR. BORES:  Correct. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  What -- what was the specific \nchange on that from the original bill?  \nMR. BORES:  It was completely eliminated. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay, great.  Thank you.  I had a \ncouple of questions related to audits.\nOkay.  Litigation, we hit on that.  All right.  I have \nanother question for you.  It look like this goes specific to, like, \nFrontier models.  Have you been, you know, speaking about that?  \nCan you better explain to -- to myself and others?  \nMR. BORES:  Yeah.  The Frontier model is -- is a \nname to describe something that is on the frontier of the current \nresearch that is happening.  It is the most powerful, the most -- the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n323largest models in general, right?  Those that have the most \ncapabilities.  And that is really when we're getting into an area that \nwe're not sure we know how to control or we certainly -- that we don't \nwant to fall necessarily into the wrong hands.  So some of the -- this \nbill in particular has been supported by -- we -- we have a letter that I \nthink I've sent around that was signed by two of the \"Godfathers of \nAI\" they're called.  \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.\nMR. BORES:  Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, \nthat won the Turing Award, which is like the Nobel Prize for \nComputer Science for inventing deep learning.  And Geoffrey Hinton \nalso separately won the Nobel Prize.  He's a very impressive man.  But \n-- but they have said they've invented this technology, they see where \nit's going, and they think based on that Frontier we need urgent action \nin order to keep people safe.  And so that's -- we're focusing on those \nrisks specifically from the Frontier models. \nMR. MAHER:  I appreciate that.  Thank you.\nI know you made some comments about some of the \nsmaller companies not being impacted by this, just the larger \ncompanies.  Would that be kind of a disincentive for some of the \nsmaller companies that might want to be bigger when they grow up \nand be more successful and become a larger company, or do you see \nthis being completely different in scale?  \nMR. BORES:  Again, the -- the opposition memo that \nsaid it will cost one full-time employee to comply with, I don't think \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n324that one person is gonna dissuade companies from wanting to grow. \nMR. MAHER:  Okay.  I appreciate the answers to all \nmy questions.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  On the bill, sir. \nMR. MAHER:  All right.  So, I am still learning.  I \nwanted to take this opportunity and the platform we have to educate \nmyself and others more.  I know that I join most New Yorkers and \nmost Americans, I believe, when I can say we -- we don't quite know \nenough about AI.  But it is not just our future, it's our right now.  It's \ngonna impact us in big ways moving forward.  And one thing that I've \nbeen learning and I've been asking is, you know, when we talk about \nState laws that are getting enacted, is that going to hurt the technology \nand its advance -- advancement.  And on the folks that we're trying to \nhelp and our society that we're trying to help, rather than hurt it.  And \none of the things that I wanted to read was a joint statement, this is \nfrom 2023 and it's, to my knowledge, still being practiced today.  A \njoint statement from the Director of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, the Assistant Attorney General for the Justice \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division, the Chair of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, the Chair of the Federal Trade \nCommission.  And this is a statement from all of them that speaks to \nFederal involvement and enforcement of AI and technology in \ngeneral.  \"America's commitment to the core principles of fairness, \nequality and justice is deeply embedded in the Federal laws that our \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n325agencies enforce to protect civil rights, fair competition, consumer \nprotection and equal opportunity.  These established laws have long \nserved to protect individuals, even as our society has navigated \nemerging technology.  Responsible innovation is not incompatible \nwith these laws, indeed benefits to people in a fair and competitive \nmanner such as increased access to opportunities, as well as better \nproducts and services at lower costs.  Today, the use of automatic \nsystems including those sometimes marketed as artificial intelligence, \nor AI, is becoming increasingly common in our daily lives.  We use \nthe term \"automated systems\" broadly to mean software and \nalgorithmic processes, including AI, that are used to automate work \nflows and help people complete tasks or make decisions.  Private and \npublic entities use these systems to make critical decisions, housing -- \nthat impact individuals' rights and opportunities, including fair and \nequal access to a job, housing, credit opportunities and other goods \nand services.  These automated systems and cost savings and \nmodernizing existing practices, although many of these tools offer the \npromise of advancement, they're used also as a potential to perpetuate \nunlawful bias, automate unlawful discrimination and produce other \nharmful outcomes.\"  \nThese are just a couple examples of some of our law \nenforcement agencies that are guarding us from AI and other \ntechnologies.  I want to make sure that we're all mindful of the current \nlaws that are on the books and the agencies that are out there trying to \nhelp with some of these protections as we continue to develop AI laws \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n326in our own State and all over.  \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, \nMaher.\nMr. Norber. \nMR. NORBER :  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield, please?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. BORES:  Yes. \nMR. NORBER :  Thank you very much. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  The sponsor \nyields.\nMR. NORBER :  It's kind of weird to speak to you \nlike this over here, but I'll manage it somehow.\nSo I just want to understand a little bit more the \ngenesis of this, where it came from, where it started.  You said earlier \nwhen you were speaking to my colleague Maher, that you spoke to \nsome of these companies.  Are -- do they share with you the idea that \nthere might be some type of critical harm that they might, even by \nthemselves, create accidentally?  \nMR. BORES:  I think their lawyers are quite careful \nin editing some of those statements, but in essence, yes.  As I -- as I \nsaid in my opening explanation, they have all signed those \ncommitments that, as I read off, I won't repeat, but say they should be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n327focused on these large harms, they should be disclosing their safety \nplans.  Those are all things that they have signed.  And then \nseparately, most of them already have safety plans that talk about \naddressing these very real harms. \nMR. NORBER :  So did we initiate this, or did they \nwant to come to us and say, Look, we need better regulation.  In some \nway, we would like you to help us do a better job at making sure that \ncritical harm doesn't occur?  Because I'm trying to understand where \nthis all comes from. \nMR. BORES:  A meeting of the minds.\nMR. NORBER :  (Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMR. BORES:  And I will say that, you know, as -- as \nan example, but Anthropic, one of the large companies, published a \nblog post on Halloween last year -- I didn't choose the date, but -- and \nthey said that the industry desperately needs regulation.  That they \nwould prefer it at the Federal level, but they don't think the Feds will \nact fast enough so they'll take it at the State level, and that it needs to \nhappen in the next 18 months.  Now, that was seven months ago, so \nthat puts us at April of 2026.  Now, I'm not saying that they have \nendorsed this specific language or any word of that, right?  I don't \nmean to imply that.  But, yes, people in industry, not just the inventors \nof AI and the academics behind it that I cited before, but some of the \ncompanies themselves are calling for it. \nMR. NORBER :  Because we know since the infancy \nof AI that there's been a lot of debate about what will be the final \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n328outcome of this.  Will this be a Terminator 2 scenario or will this be \nthe best thing that ever happened to humanity?  So I know that we \nshould take into concern that we don't wanna scare anybody with this \nbill.  We're saying here, now we have New York State admitting that \nwe need to protect ourselves from biological warfare or whatnot.  So \nare there other states that are agreeing to this type of regulation or \nlegislation?  \nMR. BORES:  I -- I think I count eight other states \nthat had or have a bill live in their legislature this year, trying to get at \nthis question.  So, yes, other states are looking at this as well. \nMR. NORBER .  Right.  So California opted out of it.  \nThey had legislation that they put in and the Governor vetoed it, \ncorrect? \nMR. BORES:  Yes.  Although, if I may, the \"it\" there \nwhen you say opt out of it is really important, right?  The Governor \nvetoed a specific bill, but he then created a commission to study what \nshould be done at the State level --\nMR. NORBER :  Right.\nMR. BORES:  -- and he put on that commission one \nperson that really opposed that bill, one person that really supported it, \nand one person who was kind of neutral.  That commission is coming \nout with its final report any day now.  But they did a preliminary \nreport two months ago, and what that sort of commission that was \nfrom people who supported and opposed the bill, came out as the \nconsensus recommendation about what should be done at the State \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n329level.  First of all, it emphasized that things need to be done fast, that \nthe window is closing.  And second of all, largely called for just the \nprovisions that are in the RAISE Act.  So I don't want it to be said that \nCalifornia rejected this.  They rejected another model and what they're \nputting out is largely in line of this. \nMR. NORBER :  Yeah, I would assume that \nCalifornia would be against it since they have Silicon Valley and they \njust wanna make sure that companies continue to grow and to move to \nSilicon Valley in order to expand AI, specifically AI.  And you're \nsaying that on the Federal level it's been too slow to put in regulations \nsuch as these protocols? \nMR. BORES:  Yup.\nMR. NORBER :  Okay.\nMR. BORES:  Well, they don't exist.  \nMR. NORBER :  They just don't exist.\nMR. BORES:  So that's sort of a sign that it's too \nslow. \nMR. NORBER :  Okay.  On the intern -- let's say \ninternet.  Let's take that for an example right now.  Who's right now \nregulating the internet, the FCC? \nMR. BORES:  Oh, yeah.  Well, the FCC plays a large \nrole.  I think a number of different Federal regulators would be \ninvolved in aspects of the internet, yes. \nMR. NORBER :  So why wouldn't they just take this \ntype of reg -- resolutions or legislation that they have there and just \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n330implement that on the same level as AI?  \nMR. BORES:  Great question for whichever party is \ncurrently controlling these agencies. \nMR. NORBER :  Okay.  Okay.  Can you please just \nexplain a little bit about the compute cost?  What does mean exactly?  \nIs that $100 million that they're spending?  \nMR. BORES:  Yeah, no, it's a great question because \n-- because it's not a phrase that exists often or is used in -- in -- on this \nfloor often.  But that's specifically, like, the -- the actual calculations \nthat these supercomputers are doing to generate the model, right?  \nThat is the compute.  In your computer it'd be a CPU, right, and then \nif you buy a computer with an enhanced one -- and these are usually \nGPUs.  That -- that detail isn't as important as -- it's the actual \ncalculations that are occurring.  And it's specifically money that is \nbeing spent doing those calculations on the final training run.  So it's \nnot any of the tests that you do.  It's not -- sometimes you build one, \nyou see how it works, you do another.  It's the final thing that goes \nout; whatever money was spent specifically on calculating that.  That \nhas to equal $100 million.  So anyone that's spending $100 million on \nthe final training run of compute, has probably spent $1 billion at least \non that model, right?  \nMR. NORBER :  As to a lot of us, AI is very new.  So \nI'm just trying to consider that what you're explaining to be operating \ncosts as a business. \nMR. BORES:  Yes, but it's --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n331MR. NORBER :  (Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMR. BORES:  -- a specific line item of the operating \ncosts, not broad operating costs.  \nMR. NORBER :  So if they're that big and they're big \nenough to spend $100 million on their models, then, in my opinion -- \njust tell me, right?  How did you get to $30 million as a -- as a penalty, \nwhich is a third of their operating costs.  Does that sound \n(indiscernible/cross-talk) -- \nMR. BORES:  Well, yeah.  It's not their operating \ncosts broadly, right?  It's a very specific piece of it.  And actually now \nwe're getting a new accounting.  I'm not sure, there might be capital \ncosts because it's training intellectual property.  But -- but in either \ncase, you know, the -- they -- the penalties are set up to be up to that \namount, right?  And so -- and it takes into account the severity of the \nviolation.  So if a company were to say, We don't care.  We're not \nfollowing  all of this and we're releasing the most dangerous model we \ncan find, right, that's when you start getting into that large territory.  If \nit's a small thing, it would be a small one. \nMR. NORBER :  Now, isn't AI and the machine \nlearning, isn't that something they share amongst all these \norganizations?  Does Meta and Google and everybody all together, do \nthey go and they share together all the information and that's how we \nsaw four months ago pictures of AI which were -- looked -- looked \nnothing like they do today.  Like today they're so much more \nadvanced.  It seems like the machine learning constantly learns, and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n332within hours or days we have a whole totally new advanced system. \nMR. BORES:  Well, I -- I think you have a lot of \nadvanced actors pursuing similar things, and also just robust \ncommunication between different researchers.  So I don't know that \nthere's the direct sharing in the way you're implying, other than \npublishing papers in that aspect.  But certainly they're sharing of -- \nMR. NORBER :  But They're sharing.\nMR. BORES:  Yeah.\nMR. NORBER :  So let's say one bad actor, he is \ndeveloping something that could be -- create ultimately critical harm, \nand another company gets that information somehow.  I mean, who \nwould be to blame in that situation? \nMR. BORES:  So --\nMR. NORBER :  I'm trying to give you a very crazy \nhypothetical.\nMR. BORES:  No, it's -- listen, we're talking about \nbioweapons.  \nMR. NORBER :  Exactly.\n(Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMR. BORES:  We can discuss everything here.  The \nresponsibility lies with the original developer in this bill.\nMR. NORBER :  Right.\nMR. BORES:  And so whoever developed that \nmodel, that's the person who we would be looking at their safety plan, \nwe'd be looking at their -- their aspect.  Again, anything that happens \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n333after it's deployed is already existing common law, and liability would \nof course deal with that.  But this -- we'd be analyzing the safety plan \nof the initial developer. \nMR. NORBER :  Okay.  And if they see all of a \nsudden that they're going in that direction which has to do with \nbiological weapons or with taking down airplanes or whatnot, then all \nof a sudden they have to give you a call -- we have to put these safety \nprotocols in place because now we're becoming dangerous?  Because \nat what point do they understand --\nMR. BORES:  Yeah.\nMR. NORBER :  -- because it's so going fast.  I'm just \ntrying to understand how quickly so they know what type of safety \nprotocols they need to develop. \nMR. BORES:  Well, almost every large developer -- I \nthink every large developer, but I don't want to say that definitively --  \nalready has a safety plan.  And the way that most of them are \nstructured -- and most of them are released publicly -- and the way \nmost of them are structured say, These are the kinds of tests we will do \nto determine the capabilities of the model , and then we'll take certain \nactions based on the capabilities .  So whether that action is releasing \nit or not or whether that reaction is, We're gonna limit access to it and \nmonitor it much more closely or we'll put additional  (indiscernible), \nthey get to design the test.  They get to design the mitigations for the \nharms.  They just need to have some plan to do that.  This isn't exact, \nbut it's somewhat analogous to saying the tobacco companies knew  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n334cigarettes caused cancer but released -- denied it publicly and released \nit anyway.  Or the oil companies knew --\nMR. NORBER :  Right.\nMR. BORES:  -- they were causing climate change \nbut denied it and released it anyway.  This is saying if you're failing \nyour own tests and your own tests are saying, Hey, there's a risk here , \nyou probably shouldn't release it. \nMR. NORBER :  It's a good example you give right \nnow because if we think about the internet or social media, which we \njust created a few years ago in 2007, and right now we understand the \nharms of it.  Especially the mental harms that we have in this.  So \nmaybe we should do safety protocols for that, also. \nMR. BORES:  We'd love to have that conversation.  \nYesterday we had a bunch of youth advocates up to talk about how we \nmissed the boat with social media --\nMR. NORBER :  Right.\nMR. BORES:  -- and we've had all these harms and \nlet's not miss it again with AI. \nMR. NORBER :  No problem.  Thank you very much.\nMR. BORES:  Thank you.\nMR. NORBER :  On the bill, Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  On the bill, sir. \nMR. NORBER :  It's just -- it's a very interesting and \nfascinating subject, and I thank the sponsor for putting this forward.  \nThere's a lot of things that we have to understand and what we're --  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n335understand what we're getting into in terms of AI.  At the same time, I \nbelieve that we also protect businesses who want to move to this State \nand to grow.  Especially in this field where there's so much \ncompetition between states, between countries; China, Iran, whatnot.  \nSo we need to make sure that we still allow them and pushed them to \ncome to New York State to do business, and -- and expand AI \ncapabilities in our State.\nSo thank you very much. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, sir.\nWe have Mr. Otis. \nMR. OTIS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  And I \nthank the sponsor.  And people should be aware, the sponsor's worked \nvery hard on this bill, worked very closely with our Science and \nTechnology Committee staff -- \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Are you on the \nbill, sir?  \nMR. OTIS:  Pardon me? \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Are you on the \nbill?  \nMR. OTIS:  I'm on the bill.  I want -- I want to give \nMr. Bores time to relax.  So worked very closely with the Science and \nTechnology Committee staff on amendments to the bill.  Worked with \noutside groups that had critiques about the original language, and \nmodifications were made.  This was a B-print on this bill.  And so -- \nto be commended for that. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n336Mr. Blumencranz mentioned the California bill.  \nEven from the beginning of the introduction of this bill here, Mr. \nBores' bill is much narrower than the bill that was vetoed in \nCalifornia.  Really a different bill focused on high-risk situations and \n-- and curated that way to -- to harms.  \nWhat I'd say more generally is bills like this are \nhighly technical.  They take a lot of time.  They take a lot of rigor.  \nThey are subject to change.  So the issue was -- was well, what are we \ngonna do a year from now or six months from now.  The reality is, \nlegislation like this is gonna have to be monitored every session and \nupdated as the technology changes, and that's very important.  That is \nexpected.  This is -- these topics are very challenging for lawmakers in \nthe United States and around the world because they -- they move \nmost quickly.  But I think one cautionary note, I would say, most of \nthe people that write on these issues, indicate that the one thing that \nwe cannot do is let these technologies go unregulated without \nguidelines.  The -- the disaster situation is -- is that this -- this area just \ntakes us over without the kind of legislative action that we're doing \nhere.  This will be a leading act around the country.  Thank you for \ndoing that.  Who knows what Washington is gonna come up with.  We \nhave to protect ourselves, protect our people, and hopefully be a guide \nto industry around the world by laying down a good framework here. \nThis is a good bill.  I'll be voting yes.  I recommended \na yes -- recommend a yes vote for everybody.  I'll tell you, carefully \ncrafted, narrow to the need.  This is a good bill.  We should adopt it \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n337tonight.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, Mr. \nOtis.\nNext up, Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. BORES:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  The sponsor \nyields. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  And full \ndisclosure, you know, as I believe you know from our previous \nconversations kind of offline, this is not something that I know a lot \nabout, and I'm not really comfortable with it.  So just -- if you could \npossibly just dumb it down, you're not gonna offend me at all because \nthat's really what I'm gonna need to get through this. \nMR. BORES:  I would disagree of your \ncharacterization that you've given of your own knowledge, based on \nearlier conversations. \nMS. WALSH:  No, it's really pretty low.  But let --   \nlet's go anyway.  Let's go.  All right.\nSo, one of the things -- just -- I -- I guess as an \nattorney thinking about this, and you and I had discussed that the -- \nthe gold standard solution here would be a solution at the -- at the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n338Federal level, right?  I mean, that's what we want to see. \nMR. BORES:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  But we haven't seen it yet.  \nMR. BORES:  Yep.\nMS. WALSH:  Is there anything in draft yet that you \nknow of?  Isn't it part of the Big Beautiful Bill or am I wrong?  \nMR. BORES:  No.  In fact, the Big -- I'll use the word \n-- Beautiful Bill -- \nMS. WALSH:  Well, we all know what that means. \nMR. BORES:  Yes, yes, yes.  I will use its formal \nname -- is, in fact, taking a step to try to ban states from taking any \nregulation in this space.  So I actually think it's going the other way.  \nThere are drafts -- there are bipartisan drafts at the Federal level to do \nsome pieces of -- of AI regulation, which I think is encouraging.  As -- \nas we've discussed and as the Senate showed earlier today, this is a \nreally a bipartisan issue.  But given the speed of AI and the risk that \nindustry and experts are saying could come this year or next year --\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMR. BORES:  -- it's really something we can't afford \nto wait on. \nMS. WALSH:  No, I know.  And that's what's \nterrifying to me, because -- and I've said it before, I just think that this \n-- it's not just us here in the Assembly, it's really any government.  \nYou know, it's a deliberative, kind of slow-moving process, generally \nspeaking, and sometimes it takes a couple of sessions to get bills done.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n339We've all had that experience.  So it -- it's terrifying to me to think that \nthe pace of technology in this area could so quickly outpace our ability \nto keep up with it.  So I'm mindful of that as I ask these questions.  \nBut -- so, I believe that we had spoken before that there was almost \nlike a consortium of states that was trying to work on this issue \ntogether.  So what happened with that?  \nMR. BORES:  It depends exactly what you're \nreferring to, because there have been a few attempts at this.  But -- so \nmaybe if you clarify I -- I could answer the question.\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  So, I mean, like, we -- I \nbelieve it was already mentioned about the California --\nMR. BORES:  Yes.\nMS. WALSH:  -- the situation in California, and then \nthere's Colorado, right?  \nMR. BORES:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  So, but this bill that we're taking up \ntonight, that doesn't match Colorado's bill, right?  \nMR. BORES:  Correct.  It does not.  And -- and I \nwould say, so I -- I would never -- using the word consortium would \nbe far too grandiose for what I'm about to describe, but I am on a text \nthread with legislators in six states that are working on this and we --  \nMS. WALSH:  Like a multistate group --\nMR. BORES:  Yeah, yeah.\nMS. WALSH:  -- of interested legislators; is that fair?  \nOkay.  So but why doesn't this bill then align with, say, Colorado's, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n340which passed, if the stated goal of the multistate group of legislators \nworking on these bills was to avoid a patchwork of obligations for \ncompanies that are building AI tools?  \nMR. BORES:  So -- so I think what you're referring \nto was -- was there was this multistate working group that the Future \nof Privacy Forum was involved in and Connecticut was involved in.  \nAnd Colorado passed a consumer protection bill that became a model \nbill that could be used elsewhere, and I actually currently carry a bill \nwith Senator Gonzalez that is based on that model bill.  Colorado did \nnot do a Frontier AI bill that we're focusing on here.  The only thing \nthat I think that came close in previous Sessions was California; we've \nalready discussed the differences quite a bit. \nMS. WALSH:  Right.\nMR. BORES:  There have been, as I said, I think \nabout eight states that had some version of a Frontier model bill this \nyear. \nMS. WALSH:  So it's kind of -- it's kind of like \napples and oranges then.  That -- that Colorado bill was just a different \nbill. \nMR. BORES:  Correct. \nMS. WALSH:  It -- it's not like it was a -- a different \napproach to the same problem, it's just a different bill.  \nMR. BORES:  Absolutely.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right, I understand that.\nSo could you help me to understand -- I understand \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n341the concept of, believe it or not, of the Frontier model, and I \nunderstand the concept of, like, how much of an investment the \ncompany would have had to put into development in order to qualify.  \nBut are we only talking about -- we're not just talking about New York \nState companies that are doing this work, are we or are we?  \nMR. BORES:  No. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right. \nMR. BORES:  Any company that is deploying its \nproduct in New York.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  It could be --\nMR. BORES:  So they don't to be headquartered \nhere.  Yeah, it would apply to everyone.  \nMS. WALSH:  Would they be U.S. companies or \ncould they be from anywhere?  \nMR. BORES:  If they are deploying their product in \nNew York, they can be from anywhere. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And could you kind of -- could \nyou give me a sense of -- in this field of companies that would meet \nthis criteria, what are we talking about U.S. companies versus foreign \ncompanies, like, percentage-wise?  Are there more foreign ones?  Are \nthere -- is it about even?  \nMR. BORES:  No, I -- I think it's mostly American \ncompanies --\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. BORES:  -- that are really at the forefront of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n342this.  Yeah.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right. \nSo, how -- so I noted that Governor Hochul, when \nshe gave her State of the State Message, I think, or maybe it was like a \nsubsequent press conference, made a really big deal about saying that \nNew York is gonna lead, you know, in AI. \nMR. BORES:  Absolutely. \nMS. WALSH:  So does this bill help further that goal \nor not?  \nMR. BORES:  I -- I would argue that it does.  And I \n-- I think the Governor has been fantastic in that regard of setting up \nNew York in that way.  I think Empire AI was quite visionary, and we \ndesigned this bill to make sure it in no way interfered with that.  We \nexempted academic research, and I spoke with Empire AI and had \nspoken in favor of it quite a bit.  So I think New York is leading and \nwill continue to lead.  This is a very light-touch bill.  I think the thing \nthat would most set back AI innovation or AI research would be one \nof these catastrophic incidents happening.  And so I view it as very \npro-innovation to make sure we don't have the extreme worst case \noccur. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So when you say \"light touch\", \nI mean, did the B-print, though, still contain the penalties?  Fines and \npenalties?  \nMR. BORES:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  That doesn't seem super light touch to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n343me.  I mean, that -- \nMR. BORES:  Well, I think Amazon's quarterly profit \nwas, like, $30 billion.  Microsoft, like, $100 billion.  \nMS. WALSH:  Well, they could probably afford it.  \nI'm just saying. \nMR. BORES:  And you're saying and up to 10 \nmillion or up to 30 million for the most extreme violations of maybe \nhelping to increase the risk of 100 deaths or a billion in damage?  \nMS. WALSH:  Well, we could talk about \ncost-benefit.  You know, that's a different discussion.  But I'm just -- I \nwas just thinking about, like, some of the opposition to the bill talks \nabout how by tying fines to a company's total compute spend and \npersonnel head count, this bill penalizes the very resources that drive \nAI research and development.  So would your response to that be the \nfines are so miniscule compared to the total value of these companies \nthat it's a blip and it's not gonna really affect innovation?  \nMR. BORES:  Compared to the value, also compared \nto the potential harms.  But I -- I don't know when that specific \nopposition was released.  The first version of this bill, the penalties \nwere a percentage of the spend, so it might have been referencing that. \nMS. WALSH:  It was on the original print.  \n(Indiscernible/cross-talk). \nMR. BORES:  Right.  So we -- we've edited --\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. BORES:  -- it to make it fix to address that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n344directly. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Got it.  Well, I appreciate your \nwillingness to continue to amend the bill to address, you know, \nconcerns that are being raised as they're being raised.  That's a -- that's \na good thing. \nMR. BORES:  Thank you. \nMS. WALSH:  All right.  I -- I mean, I think that -- I \nthink that you've answered the questions that I had, and so I appreciate \nyour time.  Thank you.  \nMR. BORES:  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, Ms. \nWalsh.\nMr. Chang. \nMR. CHANG:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. BORES:  Yes. \nMR. CHANG:  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  And \nit's been a couple years since I retired in -- in the Navy, but for over 20 \nyears in the Navy I worked in intelligence, cybersecurity, \ncyberwarfare.  In intelligence field, especially information warfare for \nover 20 years.  And AI has been around for about 30 years.  Actually \nmore than that.  But other forms of programming.\nMR. BORES:  Yes.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n345MR. CHANG:  But this RAISE Act, how do you see \nthe parameters to safeguard this once it's been implemented?  What \nkind of parameters you -- you envision with this -- with this bill?  \nMR. BORES:  Which parameters are we providing --\nMR. CHANG:  Safety itself, for example.  You \nmentioned about safety.\nMR. BORES:  Yeah.  So what it asks the developers \nto do is to have a safety plan, and we have some standards for what \nthat plan needs to contain; cybersecurity, testing on critical harms, et \ncetera, to -- again, if their own tests are showing that it has a \nreasonable risk of a critical harm to amend their procedures and to \ndisclose critical safety incidents quickly so that we know about them \nand can prepare. \nMR. CHANG:  Because from my training from what \n-- what I understand in AI and cyber, because critical infrastructure is \nbased on information.  And as is AI machine-learning itself and \nFrontier is the most advanced model currently right now, unless they \nchange another -- another -- another label.  But all I can see from large \ninstitution doing -- probably not doing anything nefarious, they want \nto sell to consumers or to businesses to hopefully to enhance their -- \ntheir profit.  I mean, I can see AI into market.  I can see into a fashion \nindustry.  I can see into audio-visual because they can manipulate \nanimation.  Okay?  But I don't see deaths. \nMR. BORES:  I -- I would agree with you.  I'm not \nsaying that any developer is trying to cause deaths, certainly, and I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n346think most have acted responsibility and probably will continue.  But \nwhen you're talking about risks of this scale that all of the companies \nacknowledge are real concerns with their products and that largely \nthey already test for, it really just takes one person not being \nintentionally bad, but being unintentionally sloppy or not up to the \nstandards that need to be.  And it's easy to talk about safety and design \na safety plan when you're not held to it.  But what I want to make sure \nis that when you're chasing your next quarterly profit or when the race \nfor the next big advanced AI is there and there's an extreme economic \nincentive to take a shortcut on your safety plan, that we make sure that \nincentive is eliminated. \nMR. CHANG:  AI is basically programming.  And -- \nand until -- unless they -- I will be more cautious on smaller company \nand -- and other State actors, other countries writing programming and \ntrying to scam or steal money or -- or secrets or trade secrets.  \n(Indiscernible) will see probably more realistic. \nMR. BORES:  I -- I think you're right.  Cybersecurity \nis a big risk with these.  We've seen many of these models already \nused to create cyber attacks.  So, yes, that -- that is a real threat in the \nwild for sure.  \nMR. CHANG:  Because, like you mentioned in \nChina, Iran or -- or even North Korea, why they can do successfully \nand I don't think we can because they control the internet.  They \ncontrol the information flow.  They control the IPs.  They can turn on \nand off from your -- from your desk.  We don't do that.  So it's -- I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n347mean, what you're trying do is bold and noble, but I -- I can't even see \nthat our government would try to turn on and off our IPs, unlike China \nor Iran.  \nMR. BORES:  Well, I don't know if this is what \nyou're getting at, but there is no kill switch in the bill like there was in \n-- in the California version.  This isn't about turning on or off \nanything.  It doesn't really give the government any direct control of \nmodels or model releases.  It's simply setting up the standards.  The \ncompanies design their own SSP within some basic -- I'm sorry, safety \nand security plan, within some basic parameters that are defined in the \nbill and then we make sure they follow it. \nMR. CHANG:  We have a lot of programmers in the \nUnited States, but not many programmers understand policies and \nwrite policies.  They're very, very few, even in AI.  \nSo you have a working group that talks about this?  \nBecause that's the only way I can see to craft this bill, because you just \ncan't bring this thing out of -- out of thin air without precedence.  And \nwe don't have precedence right now. \nMR. BORES:  Well, as I mentioned, I've spoken with \na lot of legislators in a lot of states.  I've spoken with many large \ndevelopers that would be covered by this extensively over the past \nyear.  I've spoken with experts that invented AI and have built AI.  \nThis has been a very collaborative process.  We've taken a lot of input \ninto designing it. \nMR. CHANG:  Have anything from -- from the DOD \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n348gets involved with that?  Because they have deep money, they have \nlarge -- they employ large hundred-pound brains to figure a lot of \nthings out.  And they always collaborative with -- with the industry.  \nHave you ever consult with the DOD? \nMR. BORES:  I have not had direct conversations \nwith DOD about this.  I would welcome those conversations.  You \nmentioned at the start also, obviously your -- your long career in the \nNavy, which -- which I thank you for your service there.  And as you \nknow, the Navy was actually pretty instrumental in a lot of early \ncomputer science development as well.  Rear Admiral Grace Hopper \n--\nMR. CHANG:  That's correct.\nMR. BORES:  -- for the longest time the \nhighest-ranking woman ever in the military service, also helped to \ninvent the first compiler and -- and invent.  And so in a comment I \ndon't know why I'm saying on the floor and probably won't live down, \nbut my wife and I, two computer scientists, named our cat Grace \nHopper.  So it's a long history that we're proud to support.  \nMR. CHANG:  It's a long history.  She -- she \ninvented FORTRAN.  Yes, I read about their history and -- and, you \nknow, I was in Washington and I worked in that field directly in \nWashington for -- for a number of years.  So I seen her biography, I \nseen her -- we celebrated her in the Navy.  So... \nMR. BORES:  A remarkable innovator. \nMR. CHANG:  Very, very remarkable.  And I'm just \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n349-- you know, with just -- you know, I -- I worked in those -- I worked \nwith those guys, the analysts who -- who does this.  Because I'm -- Im \nnot a programmer.  But I appreciate those guys.  They can pick up a \nprogram and -- program code and identify there's a problem here.  \nThere's a leak here.  Those guys are so smart.  And -- and I wish you \nhave -- I don't know we have anything -- conversation with DARPA \nand -- and DOD, because they are leading on this on this because -- to \nhelp us craft the bill.  In -- in the Federal Government it's based on \npolicies.  Policies are easily written.  They don't need to have \nCongress to -- to pass a bill.  So that was very easy for them.  And \neven though we pass this bill, what agency in the State envision to \nable enforce this?  Because I don't have faith in our -- our agency, \nboth City and State, to have those guys smart enough to -- to enforce \nthis. \nMR. BORES:  I have a different view of our \nagencies, but -- but you'll be happy to know that there's no rulemaking \nor regulation as part of this.  We specifically lay out what should be \nhappening and not.  And there's also no private right of action, no new \nprivate right of action created here.  The only enforcement is through \nthe Office of the Attorney General. \nMR. CHANG:  I hope to have some expertise in there \nbecause it's -- it's really technical, it's really very specific.  The only \nthing I can see as endanger us is -- is scamming and stealing our \nsecrets and money.  But also, enforcement.  If we do just like Bernie \nMadoff and his Ponzi, it took years just to find that.  And -- and it \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n350takes professional investment house to understand how he able to craft \nthis.  So I don't know we have somebody to detect this unless \nsomebody start to complain. \nMR. BORES:  I -- I've actually spoken to many of the \nexperts in the Office of the Attorney General.  I'm quite confident in \ntheir grasp of these issues.  But I think you're right.  I -- I think a lot of \nthese scams are happening.  I think this is complicated.  One of the \nthings I'm most excited about with AI is some of the cybersecurity \ndefense that it'll help to enable.  I mean, this -- this is a tool that's quite \npowerful.  And to your comment earlier about coders and AI, I would \nwelcome that conversation at any point.  I'd also point out, as \nmentioned in the sponsor's memo, that one of the things AI is best at is \ncoding.  And all of these companies are saying that they -- more and \nmore of the code that goes into production was written by AI itself.  \nSo the speed at which this this is acceler -- is -- is happening, that is \nitself accelerated. \nMR. CHANG:  I mean, I was almost close to going to \ngoing to coding school myself when I retired, right before I had this \nnew government job.  Seriously, I was about to go into Wall Street \nand -- and enroll in the coding school myself. \nMR. BORES:  This -- this sounds like a joke, but I \nmean it sincerely, in the off-session let's do a hackathon.\nMR. CHANG:  Yes.  So -- and you mentioned about \ntraining.  Okay?  What level of training we're talking about about this \nAI?  I can only envision is three areas, is in the industry, perhaps \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n351schools, and programmers who have self control, they're doing the \nright thing.  But what kind of training do you think that would apply \nthat could prevent this safe -- I guess safety itself?  \nMR. BORES:  Do -- do you mean training of the \nmodel or training of, like, human beings that are interacting with this?  \nMR. CHANG:  Well, of course you have to have a \nhuman being to start off with with programming. \nMR. BORES:  Yup. \nMR. CHANG:  So you -- you know, part of your bill \nis training.  So where -- where the training would be at and would we \nbe funding this training or it would be industry funding themselves?  \nMR. BORES:  The industry is funding it themselves, \nalthough I think there were -- not germane to this bill, but there were \nsome provisions in the budget that we're helping to encourage more \nstart-ups in New York and more AI work and retraining in this field.  \nSo I think that is a good use of government dollars, but that is not \nsomething that's covered here. \nMR. CHANG:  Maybe you should add in there in the \nbill later on is a code of conduct in the industry, create a code of \nconduct.  Okay?  Because -- \nMR. BORES:  That's an interesting suggestion.  We \nshould talk about it. \nMR. CHANG:  I mean, just like the Ten \nCommandments.  You've got -- you have the Ten Commandments, \nyou're supposed to do things, not supposed to.  So we -- if you codify \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n352this code of conduct, force the industry to do that, and if there is an \ninvestigation you've got a code of conduct already listed out what \nyou're supposed to do, and that's one basis that help out the law \nenforcement itself. \nMR. BORES:  I'd love to talk to you more about that. \nMR. CHANG:  Okay.  Certainly will.  And that's all I \nhave.  Thank you.\nMR. BORES:  Thank you.\nMR. CHANG:  And on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  On the bill, Mr. \nChang.  \nMR. CHANG:  Thank you.  It's a very refreshing \npiece of legislation, it is very cutting-edge because there is nothing in \ncomparison.  I searched around.  So we may be the precedence of -- of \nAI industry.  And AI is evolving.  Even for me it's hard to catch up.  \nSo it's a good start.  I'm sure there'll be many amendments along the \nway because as -- as there's a lot of nefarious actors overseas that \nmight come up with something trying to steal trades, steals money.  So \nwe have to be vigilant on that good.  But it's a good start and I \ncommend the sponsor.\nThank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you, Mr. \nChang.\nMr. Novakhov . \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n353Would the sponsor answer a few questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  The sponsor, will \nyou yield? \nMR. BORES:  Yes, I will. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  He'd be happy to.\nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Thank you.  Thank you, Alex.  \nSo first of all, I think that a lot of people in this room need some crash \ncourse on AI, on Bitcoin and et cetera.  So I would recommend doing \na crash course for Assemblymembers like a technology crash course --\nMR. BORES:  I'd love that.\nMR. NOVAKHOV :  That would be great, right?  \nMR. BORES:  Yes.\nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Okay.  So you mentioned a \nparticular date; before that date we need to do something which was \nApril 2026?  \nMR. BORES:  Correct. \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Can you be more specific why \nthis date?  What's -- what's --  \nMR. BORES:  I don't think know that there's, like, a \nthat's the month and there's nothing before and nothing after.  But -- \nbut I was getting that from a blog post that the CEO of Anthropic put \nout in, again, on Halloween this past year where he said we need \nregulation in the next 18 months if we are gonna be able to do this.  So \n18 months from October is April 2026. \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  So nothing -- no apocalypsis is  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n354-- is planned --  \nMR. BORES:  No, I'm not -- this isn't a spoiler of \nsome unexpected event.  No, I mean, to be -- to be serious about it, \nsomething could happen at any point, right, and that's you have some \nexperts that are saying -- I think a former security researcher at \nOpenAI said he expects potential harms this year.  I mean, this is -- \nwe're really playing with fire which is why it's so urgent to put some \nguardrails there. \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  So it is very hard to find a \nbalance between a necessary regulation and the power that drives AI \nresearch and development; would you agree on that?  \nMR. BORES:  Yeah.  Given the amount of work I've \nput into this bill, yes, I would say so. \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  And how this bill balances it.  \nLike, are you sure we're not overregulating the growing and extremely \nimportant industry?  \nMR. BORES:  Yes.  I think both from the opposition \nmemos that have said it's one full-time employee, from the \nconversations I've had with industry where they said, You're actually \nbeing underinclusive in the potential risks.  From the fact that the \nbiggest opposition we're getting were on the audits, and we've taken \nthe audits out.  So I think the clear signs are probably maybe we're \neven doing enough to keep us safe, but I think we, as -- as the \nMinority Floor Leader said, we have to start somewhere and I think \nthis bill is that start. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n355MR. NOVAKHOV :  And I'm -- I'm not criticizing, \nI'm just trying to learn. \nMR. BORES:  No, no, no.  That's a valid question. \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Okay.  And, again, because a lot \nof people do not understand, can you give us a very, very simple \ndown-to-earth example of what's going to happen if this bill is not \npassed or -- or if those regulations are not implemented?  \nMR. BORES:  Yeah.  And I -- and I want to be clear; \nI'm not saying anything is this deterministic, right?\nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Mm-hmm.\nMR. BORES:  But an example of the kind of thing \nthat could occur is a number of the recent labs have put out models \nwhere they said, or -- or outside researchers have tested and they've \nsaid this model could teach a novice how to build a bioweapon, could \ngive more accurate descriptions than a PhD virologist.  Right?  And so \nif you're putting that power out there when you also have a bunch of \nunregulated gene synthesizers, that becomes a dangerous combination.  \nA more recent example was -- and this was caught in testing, it's \nexactly the kind of testing this bill is meant to -- to encourage -- they \nset up their system and said they were gonna run a few tests and then \nshut it down.  And in one case they explicitly told the AI, Let yourself \nbe shut down , and in a few instances it didn't.  It actually changed the \ncode and kept itself alive.  In another instance a different model was \nagain told it was gonna to be shut down and it planted fake e-mails \nthat implied that the engineer conducting the test was having an affair \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n356--\nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Wow.\nMR. BORES:  -- and the model responded by telling \nthe engineer, Don't shut me down or I'm sending these e-mails to your \nwife. \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  Unbelievable.  All right. \nMR. BORES:  You asked for a practical example.  \nThose are, you know -- \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  That's an interesting example.\nMR. BORES:  Yeah, it's terrifying. \nMR. NOVAKHOV :  It is.  It is.  Thank you so much.  \nThank you for answering my questions.\nMR. BORES:  Thank you.\nMR.

They should feel free to do so at their seats. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Thank you.\nThe -- the Clerk will record the vote.  \n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMr. Bores to explain his vote. \nMR. BORES:  I don't want to belabor the \nconversation; we've had a long debate and a number of long debates.  \nBut I do want to thank many, many people.  This bill has been the \nwork of a better part of a year.  We've had industry experts.  We've \nhad academics.  We've had advocates, some of whom are in the \nChamber here.  And my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the \ncommittee process and through even this debate on the floor, we've \nhad wonderful debates that have strengthened this bill, that have made \nsure this bill is narrowly-tailored, and really sets up New York to be a \nleader not only in the AI innovation, but also in AI safety.  I think this \nwill end up protecting New Yorkers, but it will protect a much larger \nsegment of the country and actually the world itself.  So this is proof  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n358that we can do hard things, that we can actually move at a speed that's \nappropriate to protect people, and I want to thank everyone for that \nwholehearted effort to get there.\nI proudly vote yes. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. Bores in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Dais to explain his vote. \nMR. DAIS:  I'll be brief.  I want to congratulate my \ncolleague on this legislation.  We worked together on it.  And \nspecifically what I wanted to say thank you was that he was listening \nto the young people within our State who had concerns; the generation \nthat saw social media not have guardrails and how it negatively \nimpacted them, and now how AI is gonna have a direct impact, right?  \nFor the younger generation, AI is gonna replace a lot of jobs.  There's \na lot of things that's gonna change for that next generation and we \nneed to prepare them.  So by creating these guardrails, I think it's \ngonna make sure that New York is actually on the forefront of \ninnovation when it comes to AI.  And I might be telling my age, when \nI was a kid there was something called the Jolly Roger Cookbook.  \nAnd there was this bad thing where it taught you how to make some \nthings that you should not know how to make.  Now imagine AI times \n1,000 where someone could have a bad intention, could literally take \nand make something negative that could hurt our great State or our \ngreat country.  So making sure we put these guardrails and these \nsafety -- safety protocols in place I think is a commonsense measure \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n359while we can still be innovative and make sure that New York is a \nleader in AI.\nI'll be voting in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. Dais in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Maher to explain his vote. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I rise to \nexplain my vote.  And I want to explain it because although I will be \nin the negative, I do wanna just commend the sponsor.  He absolutely \nhas been listening to both sides of the argument, been willing to edit \nthe bills.  I look forward to working with you in the future.  And I \nthink this is no vote is more about me continuing to educate myself on \nits impact, so hopefully in the future we can -- we can get through this, \ndevelop other laws that make sense, working with other states.  But I \njust wanted to explain that and again commend the sponsor for \nexcellent back-and-forth and for being receptive to change. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. Maher in the \nnegative.\nMr. Gandolfo to explain his vote. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I, \ntoo, would like to commend the sponsor.  He's obviously very \nknowledgeable on the subject, and a lot of the points raised during the \nconversation here were very valid.  And I think I can speak for a \nnumber of my colleagues when I say the need to regulate the -- the \nrapid deployment of AI and these advancements is recognized; \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n360however, I would rather see a -- a Federal approach so there's not a \npatchwork of potentially 50 different regulations that technology \ncompanies are trying to comply with that might potentially stymie \ndevelopment in this field.\nSo for that reason I will be in the negative.  But I do \nrecognize the need for -- for regulation on this.  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. Gandolfo in \nthe negative.\nMr. Burdick to explain his vote.\nMR. BURDICK:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nthe opportunity to explain my vote.  I want to commend the sponsor of \nthis legislation for going into an area that's highly complex, but one \nwhich is extremely important for the New York economy and for the \nnational economy.  And, you know, I shared the view that a national \napproach would be preferable to state-by-state, but that hasn't been \nhappening.  And unfortunately, time is not on our side.  It's really \nimportant that we get ahead of this and we act sensibly in a balanced \nway, which I believe this bill does.  And as the sponsor has said, the -- \nthe point of this and the hope is that New York can help lead the \nnation in this.  There's a lot more work to be done, but I think this is a \nterrific start. \nThank you, and I vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER WOERNER:  Mr. Burdick in \nthe affirmative. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n361ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Are there any other \nvotes?

RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Colleagues, \nno, you're not seeing things.  You're not confused.  This is a -- a \nBudget Bill at the request of the Division of Budget.  It makes \ntechnical changes to the Aid to Localities budget bill.  They're \ntechnically -- technical in nature.  But, most notably, this bill formally \nauthorizes the State to spend the $8 billion from the Enterprise Fund \nto pay off the outstanding debt owed to the Federal Unemployment \nInsurance Trust Fund by adding a specific appropriation line for -- for \nthat dollar amount.  So, it is to clean up and make -- make very clear \nthat the Appropriation Authority is there to pay off the UI debt as -- \nwas -- was accounted for at the time of the enacted budget.  This is -- \nwas obviously a major priority I think on both sides of the aisle and \nparticular for our business community in -- in this year's budget.  And \nI'm happy to cast my vote in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Ra in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Smullen to explain his vote.\nMR. SMULLEN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I rise \nto explain my vote.  It's not often in the New York State Assembly \nthat I vote in favor of a Budget Bill, and it's interesting that it's coming \nhere at the end of Session on a Message of Necessity.  But this is, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                           JUNE 12, 2025\n363indeed, a necessity for New York State.  To liquidate the debt that \nNew York's businesses, including the 50 percent of -- of people that \nwork in small businesses all around New York State, that have been \npaying unnecessarily for over the last four years for the obligations of \nthe State because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the debt we \nincurred from the Federal Government to be able to pay those -- those \nclaims as they went along.  \nDuring the pandemic, unemployment insurance was \nthe number one issue facing the people in my district.  It was -- it was \na necessary fact that we had to borrow this money, but I think it's a bit \nof a shame that it took us over four years to pay it back, when we had \nsurpluses and we had other money that had been obligated to us from \nthe Federal Government to do so.\nSo, I -- I'm glad that this is being done.  It's about \ntime and I'm glad to vote in the affirmative for this bill.  Thank you, \nMadam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Smullen in the affirmative.\n(Pause)\nAre there any other votes?

I'm proud to sponsor this \nresolution proclaiming August 7th of this year as Purple Heart Day in \nNew York.  The Purple Heart medal carries a special gravitas, because \nit is a badge of distinction reserved for Military personnel who are \nwounded, or killed in action.  Not only does it represent bravery and \nsacrifice, it is also special because of its long and proud tradition.  In \nfact, the Purple Heart is the oldest Military decoration in the world \nthat is still awarded today.  The Purple Heart can be awarded to any \nactive Military member.  How powerful is it that here in the United \nStates, our longstanding practice is to honor every person who \nsacrifices for our freedoms.  Not based on their rank, but on their \nbravery and dedication.  In honor of every recipient of the Purple \nHeart, past and present, I ask my colleagues to please join me in \npassing this resolution to celebrate Purple Heart Day in New York this \nyear on August 7th.

SMULLEN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I rise \ntoday to introduce a fierce advocate, a great friend of mine, the \nfounder of Fentanylfathers.org, Greg Swan.  He came to the Capitol \ntoday from Detroit to help introduce the Fentanyl Fathers and Mothers \nAct, which is a demand reduction law that will help our -- help save \nour youth from accidentally ingesting a poison, fentanyl, that can kill \nthem.  He's also joined today by Sharon Richmond, a bereaved \nmother, and whom I believe Assemblymember Brown will also \nintroduce.  But this is a very important issue that I urge everyone to \ntake careful consideration and -- and get behind to help save our youth \nfrom the scourge of fentanyl poisoning.\nSo, Madam Speaker, if you could kindly introduce \nand welcome Greg and Sharon to our Chamber, it would be greatly \nappreciated. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On behalf of Mr. \nSmullen, the Speaker and all members, Greg and Karen [sic], we \nwelcome you to our Assembly Chamber.

ROZIC:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nThe purpose of this legislation is to ensure that \nindividual -- individual consumers have access to information about \nwhether a hospital or general hospital in their area provides the care \nthey seek prior to admission, and to identify healthcare deserts in \nregions of the State. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Jensen.\nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nmy friend from Queens yield for some questions?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMS. ROZIC:  Absolutely.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Rozic.  And I do just \nhave a few questions.  Let me just get my scroll out.\nIn response to this legislation, what is the -- the \ngenesis of the need for this bill?  Why -- why do we need it? \nMS. ROZIC:  Why do we need this bill?  Is that your \nquestion?  \nMR. JENSEN:  Yes. \nMS. ROZIC:  Okay.  So, we've heard from consumers \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n15all across the State that there have been situations in which they come \nto a hospital and it turns out the healthcare service that they are \nseeking or want is actually not treatment that they -- or a service that \nthey are going to get at that hospital.  So, this just creates transparency \naround that.  And if a specific hospital has a hospital-based exclusion \nit would be readily available to any consumer, publicly available so \nthey could make that informed decision before entering or getting \nadmitted to the hospital.\nMR. JENSEN:  So, is -- is the -- would the \nrequirements apply to hospitals that they may have policies for the \nentire hospital itself or every doctor who practices within the hospital, \nor is it for individual providers?  \nMS. ROZIC:  So this applies to all general hospitals \nacross New York State -- I want to be very clear about that --   \nregardless of whether they are a religious hospital or a secular \nhospital.  This also requires facility-level decision-making, not \nprovider-level decision-making.  And although some hospitals may \nhave more hospital rule exclusions than others, whether or not a \nhospital has an exclusion does not depend on their religion or their \ndoctor -- their doctor's personal beliefs. \nMR. JENSEN:  So -- so if a hospital would provide a \nmedical service but they may have one doctor within the facility that \nwill not, for whatever reason.  So it's not a hospital-based exclusion, \nbut it's provider exclusion.  Would the hospital required -- be required \nto submit that as a hospital-based exclusion because there could be a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n16circumstance where somebody coming in to an emergency department \nmay be treated by this provider who doesn't provide a service that they \nmay need, a medical treatment that they may need?  \nMS. ROZIC:  Yeah.  I think that a facility, a hospital, \ncould choose to list that on their website as one of their exclusions if \nthey choose to.  Again, we're targeting mostly the facility-wide policy \n-- the hospital rule-based exclusions.  I think that there's also a section \nof the bill that would require the Department of Health to create regs \nand rules, and if those situations were happening more than expected, \nwe would ask that the Commissioner or the Department itself come up \nwith more specific regs or rules to define that. \nMR. JENSEN:  So just digging deeper into that \nquestion, so if anywhere a memorial hospital has a doctor, Dr. John \nDoe, who doesn't provide a service.  Would they -- they would have to \nsubmit that to DOH as a policy-based exclusion.  Would the doctor's \nname be publicly listed either on the hospital's website or the DOH \nwebsite?  \nMS. ROZIC:  The bill does not speak to that at all. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  \nDoes this bill just speak to policy-based exclusions \nthat are treatment-based?  \nMS. ROZIC:  Yes.  These are based on hospital-wide \nhealth services.  There -- there's actually an exemption for -- let me \njust read it so that I don't -- it shall not include restrictions based on \nlack of equipment, available bed space in the facility, or insurance \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n17denial. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  So if a hospital, you know, \npotentially a small hospital anyplace in the State, they don't have any \ntreatment-based exclusions, but for whatever reason they may not \noffer either -- they do not offer to patients kosher or halal food.  \nWould that have to be listed as a exclusion?  Because, I mean, proper \nnutrition is a form of treatment, especially if, you know, potentially, \nyou know, a no salt or low salt, low sodium diet would be important \nfor somebody with a heart condition. \nMS. ROZIC:  So, we -- \nMR. JENSEN:  Would --\nMS. ROZIC:  Go ahead. \nMR. JENSEN:  Would not offering certain dietary -- \nnot having certain dietary restrictions be covered as a hospital \npolicy-based exclusion? \nMS. ROZIC:  Meals are not generally considered a \ntype of healthcare.  So in most, if not all circumstances, that would \nfall outside of the hospital rule-based exclusion. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  \nGoing back to the individual doctor provision.  I \nknow our former colleague from Chautauqua County, when he \ndebated this bill last year he raised a circumstance that was raised by a \nmember of his own community from the Orthodox Jewish community, \nabout how some Jewish providers may not practice -- may not provide \nnon-lifesaving treatment on the Sabbath.  If somebody is making a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n18decision maybe to not practice on the specific day, would that follow \n-- would that qualify for medical -- or a hospital-based exclusion?  \nYou know, whether it's not treating on the Sabbath, whether it's for \nreligious regions -- reasons, not -- IVF or other reproductive health \nchoices be included? \nMS. ROZIC:  Well, I'll say one of two things:  First \nis, to my knowledge I don't believe there are hospitals that don't \nprovide non-emergency care on the Sabbath.  So -- \nMR. JENSEN:  It wouldn't be the hospital itself, it \nwould be an individual provider. \nMS. ROZIC:  Again, if the hospital had a policy, they \nwould probably have to disclose it to the Department of Health.  But it \ndoesn't go down to the provider level, this is a facility-based question \nand list.  \nMR. JENSEN:  So --\nMS. ROZIC:  So that --\nMR. JENSEN:  Sorry.\nMS. ROZIC:  So that's one thing I'll say.  The second \nthing -- go ahead.  I lost my train of thought. \nMR. JENSEN:  No, so it's -- and I apologize.  I \nprobably -- I was interrupting you and I caused that, so I apologize.  \nSo if it is just a provider-based exclusion, not a \nhospital- or center-based exclusion it would not have to be submitted?  \nIndividual provider decision-making would not be a -- a -- necessary \nto report to DOH.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n19MS. ROZIC:  Correct.  And I would -- I would say \nthat a hospital has to make that decision as an administrator -- as an \nadministration.  They would have to decide what they want to put on \nthe list or not.\nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  \nIn the context of a hospital, would it be within the \ngeneral hospital itself or if a medical center -- so I'll use the University \nof Rochester Medical Center as an example.  They operate three \nhospitals within Monroe County, but it's all under the same URMC \numbrella.  Would each of those three facilities be tasked with \nreporting their own policy-based exclusions, if they had any, or would \nit be -- would each facility itself -- or could they do it under the larger \norganizational umbrella?\nMS. ROZIC:  I believe it's every general hospital. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Would -- so we've seen a lot \nof health systems start to acquire and bring into their fold \nnon-hospital-based services; urgent cares, general practitioners, \npediatricians.  Would they be covered under services that are not \nprovided within a hospital setting but under the licensing of the \norganizational entity?  \nMS. ROZIC:  No.  This only applies to general \nhospitals.  And I want to be very clear that it is because of these \nspecific mergers that we're trying to map out the health services across \nregions in the State.  I would also say that, you know, that we have \npassed this bill previously.  And one of the reasons -- apart from \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n20running out of time -- that the Governor issued her veto message was \nthat there was an exorbitant amount of cost to it.  But she was going \nbased off the fact that -- the suggestion that there are 600 hospitals \nacross the State when, in fact, the number is a lot smaller.  And not -- \nthis bill does not account for public health facilities, residential health \nfacilities, nursing homes, diagnostic treatment centers, dental clinics \nand dispensaries, rehab centers, midwifery, birth centers.  And then \nany number of other facilities.  So it only applies to general hospitals, \nof which there are around 200 across the State. \nMR. JENSEN:  What -- what if some of those \nancillary services are located within a hospital, but licensed \ndifferently?  They're -- they're using -- maybe leasing space from the \nhospital, but they're not under the hospital's license.  Would that \napply?  \nMS. ROZIC:  I guess in that very nuanced particular \nsituation, I would expect that the Department of Health would come \nup with an additional reg or rule in that particular case.  If a hospital \nor an administration feels like there is that gray area and they need \nclarification, that's when the -- the rules and requirements would kick \nin.\nMR. JENSEN:  What is -- is there a deadline -- what's \nthe deadline for a hospital having to provide this information to the \nDepartment of Health?  Is it January 1st of every year?  \nMS. ROZIC:  It's annually. \nMR. JENSEN:  Annually.  So --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n21MS. ROZIC:  And that doesn't preclude someone \nfrom doing it more than ann -- or sooner than annually.  But at \nminimum, we expect the hospital to be reporting on an annual basis so \nthat, again, consumers have full transparency of what services are \nwhere. \nMR. JENSEN:  So if DOH sets the regulation that the \nreporting date is May 1st, and so every hospital, if they do have one of \nthese policy-based exclusions, would have to report by May 1st.  But \non August 13th, Anywhere Memorial Hospital now changes their \npolicy or adds an exclusion.  Would they have to submit midcycle or \ncould they wait until the next reporting deadline to supply that \ninformation? \nMS. ROZIC:  Again, at minimum they would have to \ndo it annually, but they could choose to do it sooner than that.  And \nthe Department of Health could come and ask them to do it sooner if \nthat's the case, if that is what the Department chooses in their regs. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Certainly -- and this is -- I -- I \ndon't know the answer to this, and -- and you may not, either.  But \nwhen DOH is granting -- approving a Certificate of Need for a \nhospital to operate, is there a discussion with the operator of the \nfacility about any type of policy-based exclusions they are -- they are \n-- they already may have upon the licensing of the facility?  \nMS. ROZIC:  I've never opened a hospital or started a \nhospital, so I don't know.  But I'm happy to inquire and find out the \nanswer to that. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n22MR. JENSEN:  And -- and nor have I.  Although in \nmy debate with our friend from Brooklyn last night, I have talked \nabout Jensen Memorial Hospital as a -- an example, and we didn't -- I \ndidn't have to go through that process for that fictional hospital, either. \nSo, getting off the -- the specifics of the bill and how \nit would actually function, don't most New Yorkers, if they're not \ngoing to a hospital for an emergency purpose, but they may be going \nfor a prescheduled procedure or their doctor is practicing out of that \nhospital, wouldn't they already have a preexisting relationship with \nthat hospital and the providers and the policies that that institution \nhas?  \nMS. ROZIC:  In some cases, yes, and in others, no. \nMR. JENSEN:  Okay.  Okay.  I thank my colleague \nfor her answers. \nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. JENSEN:  Certainly, I understand and -- and can \nappreciate the need to have better information about the availability of \n-- of healthcare access in the State.  Although, I do -- I do believe, as I \nnoted towards the end, that I think that the vast majority of New \nYorkers, when they are going to a hospital, they already know what \ntype of facility it is; whether it's a religious-based healthcare facility, \nwhether there are specific exclusions that may already be on the \nbooks.  And they're aware of that either when they are determining \nwhich provider they want to be treated by or which hospital they \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n23would want to be treated by.  \nSo I understand the need for information, although I \ndo share some of the concerns about the onerous nature that this \nwould place on the facilities themselves, as well as the Department of \nHealth in having to maintain this sort of database when we have \nalready seen that the DOH has quite a bit of things on their plate.  \nAdditionally, I am concerned about -- even though it's not the intent of \nthe legislation, I am concerned about the possibility that certain \nproviders could be targeted based on what services they do and do not \nprovide.  And certainly, that -- I would have a concern about that if \nDOH interprets the text of this legislation differently than the \nsponsor's intent.\nSo while I understand and appreciate the sponsor and \nthe reasoning for this, unfortunately this will be something that I think \nis not something that I'd be able to support. \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect on the 540th \nday. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS.

An act to amend the \nExecutive Law, in relation to providing for certain victim statements \nto be taken at their workplace instead of the police department.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Ms. \nWoerner, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced.\nAn explanation has been requested.\nMs. Woerner. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n25MS. WOERNER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, and \nmy colleagues.  \nLaw enforcement is too often called to healthcare \nsettings to respond to an assault on one of our healthcare workers.  \nVery frequently, the victim of the assault is instructed that if they want \nto make a report of the assault, that they need to come to the police \nstation and make that report.  At the police station, they can wait \nseveral hours while the responding officer -- until the responding \nofficer is available to them.  And they report that they feel victimized \na second time by having to spend that time sitting in the waiting room \nof a -- a police station.  And the numbers are actually pretty \nfrightening.  The New York Times  recently reported that 55 percent of \nER physicians and 70 percent of ER nurses have been physically \nassaulted in the workplace, most often by patients, and that -- and that \nmore than a third of those resulted in physical injury.\nSo this bill would allow the victim of second degree \nassault to be given the opportunity to choose to have that report taken \nwhile they are in their workplace, rather than go to the police station, \nand to report the crime against them in a -- in a more comfortable \nsetting.  Why is this important?  Because being able -- being able to \nreport to have a record of the -- of the account is an important part of \nbuilding -- certainly building a case, but also building a -- a pattern of \nbehavior if this happens more than once.  And we don't want to \ndiscourage the victims from taking the step to report the crime.  So \nthis bill is meant to -- to address the -- the shortcomings in the current \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n26policy and procedures. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Angelino.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWill the sponsor of the 113th District please yield?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. WOERNER:  I would be delighted to yield.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Good morning.\nMS. WOERNER:  Good morning.\nMR. ANGELINO:  I -- I've read through all of this, \nand I've also read through the Executive Law section that's -- that's \ngoing to be amended.  Can you explain who -- who is this directed at?  \nIs it at the hospital as an employer, or the police officers who respond? \nMS. WOERNER:  So I would say both.  I would \ncertainly hope that the employer would inform their employees that \nthey have the right, should this happen to them.  And as I said, the \nnumbers are pretty significant.  If you work in a hospital, this is likely \nto happen to you.  That they, the hospital themselves, would inform \ntheir employees of what their rights are.  But I would also hope that \nthe responding officer would also inform the -- the victim that they \nhave the option and to -- to ask them what -- what their preference \nwould be; to give the -- to immediately give the report or to \nsubsequently go to the station and -- and offer the report. \nMR. ANGELINO:  I wasn't sure if it was directed \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n27at -- because it sounds like something happened somewhere, and \neither the hospital as an employer didn't want that happening in the \nER or in their workplace, or if it was directed at officers.\nMS. WOERNER:  You know, I can't speak for all \nhospitals or for all occasions.  What I can say is that the genesis of this \nbill came from conversations with emergency room nurses at one of \nmy local hospitals.  And it was definitely a case that it was the -- the \nofficer who was suggesting to them that if they wanted to make a \nreport they would need to come to the police station.  I've \nsubsequently spoken to executives from many of the Upstate \nhospitals, and when I relay this question to them and -- and ask them \nif this is what they're experiencing, they're all nodding their heads \n(demonstrating). \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  I read the section of the \nExecutive Law that's called the Fair Victim Witness, you know, \nsection of the Executive Law, and it's pretty broad and it concerns all \ndistrict attorneys and police, victims.  But this -- this amendment \nseems oddly specific when we're dealing with the big broad.  So who \nare the victims that we're trying to protect here?  Because it just says \n\"victims.\" \nMS. WOERNER:  Right.  So it's -- it's healthcare \nworkers.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.\nMS. WOERNER:  So it is the emergency room \nnurses, the emergency room doctors, the aides.  The volunteers, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n28perhaps, but mostly it is the -- it is the healthcare worker -- workers \nthemselves. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  So x-ray technicians?  \nMS. WOERNER:  Absolutely.  Respiratory \ntherapists.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Phlebotomists, whatever.\nMS. WOERNER:  Yes.\nMR. ANGELINO:  And just so you know, my wife \nwas -- was an RN for 30-plus years, and she was assaulted in her \noffice when she was a nurse practitioner.  A drug-seeking person \nwanted painkillers and she said Tylenol will do, and that set the \nperson off.  So --  \nMS. WOERNER:  I'm sorry.  That should not happen \nto any -- anyone, and it certainly shouldn't happen to our healthcare \nworkers. \nMR. ANGELINO:  So in the -- in this, another thing \nthat stands out that's oddly specific is Assault Second, which is a D \nfelony.  But 642 mentions a whole list of violent crimes.  Why is it \nonly assault?  Why not robbery?  Why not grand larceny? \nMS. WOERNER:  Well, because we're -- what we're \ndealing with here are the experiences that our healthcare workers are \nhaving in their workplace.  And so the Assault 2 category includes, \nyou know, intent to commit physical injury, cause a serious physical \ninjury.  It is actually in the -- in the -- in the Penal Law it's actually a \npretty strong catchall dealing with the kinds of physical violence that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n29healthcare workers often face. \nMR. ANGELINO:  And my curiosity for only assault \nis because in the instance of my wife, she was pushed against the wall \nand held there, and the drug seeker, I -- I'm pretty sure, grabbed her \nprescription pad, and -- which is a robbery.  \nMS. WOERNER:  True.\nMR. ANGELINO:  But that wouldn't be covered \nunder this. \nMS. WOERNER:  No, but perhaps that's another bill \nwe could do together next year. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  The -- and I did not look \nup what the -- the law was on the definition of a healthcare facility.  \nSo does this cover a doctor's office, an urgent care clinic?  \nMS. WOERNER:  It is -- the -- the -- an enumerated \nfacility.  So it would be an Article 28 facility, which would include a \n-- clinics, doctors' offices -- no, not -- excuse me, not doctors' offices \n-- hospitals, nursing homes.  And then I also believe it does include \nphysicians' offices, diagnostic and treatment centers. \nMR. ANGELINO:  And I'm not well-versed in \nwhatever that section of definitions of healthcare facilities.  But is that \nlike a -- I -- I saw a nursing home is specific in there.  How about a \nrehab facility?  \nMS. WOERNER:  A rehab -- a rehab facility is a \nnursing home. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n30MS. WOERNER:  Yes.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you.  We have everything.  \nAnd I know a lot of dementia patients become assaulted.  They never \nget arrested because they're mentally incompetent --\nMS. WOERNER:  Right.\nMR. ANGELINO:  -- for that.  But that is a frequent \nthing that we do. \nMS. WOERNER:  And I think this is about \nrespecting the victim and -- and making sure that they have an \nopportunity to tell their story to law enforcement and have a record \nbuilt of it so that if it is -- if it is a repeat offense, that it rises in the -- \nin the level of severity. \nMR. ANGELINO:  The -- this -- again, it doesn't say \nwho.  It doesn't say doctor, nurse, x-ray tech.  It just says \"victim.\"  \nBut what about witnesses in the ER?  A lot of times there is another \ncoworker, witnesses, also we'd like to get statements from. \nMS. WOERNER:  And -- and we would hope that the \nlaw enforcement officer would take the opportunity with all of the -- \nthe witnesses available to them in the facility to -- to do those \ninterviews.  But the concern that we're -- that we're focused on is \nmaking sure that the victim who has been assaulted in the workplace \ndoesn't feel assaulted a second time or victimized a second time by \nhaving to go and spend hours sitting in the waiting room of a police \nstation. \nMR. ANGELINO:  In the Executive Law section that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n31you're amending, 642, Section 4, I have it right here, but that requires \npolice and DAs to explain to employers and victims and witnesses \nhow important it is.  Doesn't -- doesn't that suffice in the prosecution \nportion that that's already in there?  That's why I said this is oddly \nspecific to one -- one crime and one person and one workplace, when \nthis is encompassing all.  Why do we need to single this one \nworkplace out?  \nMS. WOERNER:  Because 70 percent of ER nurses \nand 55 percent of ER physicians across the State are experiencing this \nkind of workplace violence.  So I would say that when the frequency \nof this kind of workplace violence rises to that level, it's worthy of \nspecial consideration. \nMR. ANGELINO:  I -- I know liquor stores are in the \nsame boat when people come in, need their alcohol and don't have \ntheir ID or for whatever reason.  But there -- there's another workplace \nthat experiences high assault and confrontation.\nMS. WOERNER:  And -- and again, a great idea.  I'm \nhappy to work with you on a bill like that next year.\nMR. ANGELINO:  No, bad idea.  We don't need to \nkeep singling out individual special interests.  The -- \nMS. WOERNER:  I would just say that I don't think \nhealthcare workers are a special interest.\nMR. ANGELINO:  The -- so hospitals are a static \nlocation.  They don't move.  Same with doctors' offices, all these.  \nThey're a building someplace. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n32MS. WOERNER:  Yes. \nMR. ANGELINO:  And they're definitely within \nsomebody's jurisdiction  of law enforcement. \nMS. WOERNER:  Yes. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Have you talked to any law \nenforcement or district attorneys about this?\nMS. WOERNER:  I have not. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Because this seems better suited \nthat a static hospital in the City of Norwich is policed by the City of \nNorwich Police Department where an ER director, or ED they call \nthem now, emergency department director, or even the hospital \npresident could reach out to a law enforcement executive and say, We \nneed to do this .  Do we need to create a law Statewide for every \nhospital and every police agency? \nMS. WOERNER:  I would say that there are a lot of \nthings that from a commonsense perspective could be handled without \na law, but yet, they don't get handled without a law.  And so just like \nall the other ones that we do, this is a way to say, Here's how it should \nwork, and here's how we want it to work.  And so this is the way \nyou're gonna do it.   \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  So we have to create a law \nfor this.\nMS. WOERNER:  I would -- I would prefer that we \ndidn't have to, but I think it's -- given the fact that this is happening so \nfrequently and from the conversations I've had with healthcare facility \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n33executives, it's happening -- the -- the issue of the victims having to go \nto law enforcement to make the report is happening frequently enough \nthat we -- we need to make sure that we establish the rules. \nMR. ANGELINO:  And that's why you should have \ncontacted New York State Association of Chiefs of Police.  Mr. \nPhelan, I'm sure, would send out an e-blast to everybody saying, Look \nit, if we don't start doing this they're gonna create a law.  Just, you \nknow, be user-friendly.  And we have a pretty good network of -- of \ncommunicating amongst agencies.  But you said you didn't contact \nanybody, just -- just the nurses?\nMS. WOERNER:  Just the hospitals. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  Well, it takes two, and we \ncould have maybe avoided all of this. \nWhat if -- and I see it says \"may\" for victims and it \nsays \"shall\" for police.  So it's up to the victim.  Because some of \nthese victims want to go on overtime and say, At the end of my shift I \nwill go in and do the statement. \nMS. WOERNER:  And perhaps they do.  The -- the \nrequirement is that the police officers say, You have the option.  \nWould you like me to take your statement here or would you rather do \nit at the end of your shift, or whenever , at the police station.  That is \nthe -- that is the complete requirement that we're asking law \nenforcement to do; simply say, You have the option.  You're the \nvictim.  You have the option.  Which would you prefer to do?  It seems \nlike a pretty small ask if you -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n34MR. ANGELINO:  Oh, there's -- there's plenty of \nthose in the Executive Law that require police to advise and there's a \nlong list of those.  And this is just one more that will add to it.  But it's \nsituational and they adapt and they know, Okay, I'm going into a \nhospital, I have to do this now.  But it could have been avoided.  You \nknow, it sounds like one cop and one nurse someplace got into a spat.\nMS. WOERNER:  I -- I'm sorry you characterize it \nthat way.  I can assure you it was not a single individual who had this \nproblem. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  \nAnd victim is not defined.  So it could be anybody. \nMS. WOERNER:  Yes.  A victim could be anybody, \nbut it is directed at healthcare workers. \n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANGELINO:  And do you want to follow up?  \nMS. WOERNER:  It is very specific in here as to who \nthe victim is.  It is a -- it is at their workplace, provided the workplace \nis the scene of the assault, and is a hospital, emergency facility, \nnursing home or residential care facility as defined in this section is a \n-- or a facility or hospital defined in Mental Hygiene Law.  So they \nhave to be working --\nMR. ANGELINO:  Right.\nMS. WOERNER:  -- in one of those facilities. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  So what about the two \nmaintenance guys at a nursing home who get into a fight over who's \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n35using whose DeWalt battery and it comes to blows?  They're victims, \nthey're in that workplace, and he was assaulted and it's Second \nDegree.  So it covers these people, too, correct?  \nMS. WOERNER:  Yes.  It would cover those people, \ntoo.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.\nMS. WOERNER:  Again, I go back to 70 percent of \nthe ER nurses and 55 percent of ER doctors are being assaulted in \ntheir workplace.  Don't you think that that is an important enough \nproblem that we should put some focus on it? \nMR. ANGELINO:  I think if it was that important we \nwould have contacted law enforcement agencies to explain this and \nshow them the statistics.  And you probably would have got willful \ncompliance instead of this.  But I do know 100 percent of law \nenforcement calls are always different.  And when you start getting \nspecificity in here, it -- it doesn't fit.  And that's why I gave the \nexample of the two maintenance workers in a nursing home, because \nI'm sure that's happened someplace and could be happening now. \nAssault, Second.  D felony.  Pretty serious.  I don't \nknow what the sentencing is on that, but it's a felony and it's not the \nlowest, Class E.  So it's a D felony.  And all of the evidence will be \nscrutinized in that.  So what you're gonna have is a handwritten \nstatement taken in an ER in place of a typewritten statement, you \nknow, using a printer in a police station.  Which do you think is gonna \nget picked apart the most if this comes to trial?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n36MS. WOERNER:  Well, I'm old enough to have \npredated computers.  And I'm gonna say that law enforcement did a \ngood job before computers, and I would feel like it's probably pretty \ntrue they'll do a good job whether it's handwritten notes or whether it's \ntypewritten notes. \nMR. ANGELINO:  I -- I, too, started with pen and \npencil and wrote tickets and statements. \nI was -- like I said, I was just a little concerned about \nvictim wasn't defined.  We know because we're standing here talking \nabout it.  It's nurses, healthcare workers and things like that.  But it \njust says \"victim\" and that's big and broad and I was concerned about \nthat.\nBut I thank you so much.  And I know all of the \nnurses and healthcare workers really appreciate this.  It's an option for \nthem, and -- yes.  Yes, I did that.  Thank you.  But I -- I appreciate \nthis.  Thank you very much.\nMS. WOERNER:  Thank you.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. ANGELINO:  So if people are listening, I -- I \ntried to speak slowly today because I'm a little tired.  Probably the \nonly one who noticed was our stenographer and I know they \nappreciate it.  \nBut this is a case that would probably have been \nbetter suited to be handled locally, case-by-case.  As I said and as the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n37sponsor told me, no law enforcement agency was contacted about the \nstaggering numbers of assaults.  I know it.  Every police department \nwith a hospital in their jurisdiction , I guarantee you, has a working \nrelationship especially with the emergency department because there's \nusually a police car there either working or they're spending time there \nbecause they know there's free coffee there.  There's already a working \nrelationship that could have been just asked.  And the Association of \nPolice Chiefs [sic] or DCJS through the accreditation process could \nhave dictated this in the accreditation portion.  We don't need to create \na law that says \"shall\" when it's directing police officers to do \nsomething, even though it's commonsense.  All you have to do is ask.\nYou know, I -- I fear that now other special interest \ngroups and other employee groups or unions will start saying, What \nabout liquor stores?  What about retail?  What about Walmart and all \nof these people?  I guarantee you, officers are trying to be as efficient \nas possible.  Some agencies are very busy.  They will go there, make \nsure every -- there's -- whatever the threat is has stopped.  But a Class \nD felony deserves the attention that a Class D felony sentence will \nprovide.  And a typewritten statement with detail at a police station \nwith photograph equipment and other forensic evidence gathering is \nmuch better than trying to do it in a busy emergency room, even if it's \noff -- and I've done it before.  You go to the med room where it's quiet \nand you can close the door and take a handwritten statement.  We've \ndone it.  We'll do whichever is best.  And the victim always dictates \nwhat is best.  We don't demand anything.  There are busy agencies \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n38that say, I have to go to the next call.  Can you come to the station \nwhen we're done?   And generally, an ER nurse or doctor understands \nthat.  The -- and in Executive Law Section 642, sub 4, it already \ndistricts police officers and district attorneys and employers to work \nfor the best interest of victims and witnesses.  So this just adds a -- a \nvery specific portion of Section 642 of this law. \nYou know, in my experience, and I've had a lot in \nthis situation, people at a crime scene are usually excited, hyped up, \nand want everything done to the fullest extent of the law.  And we'll \ngo through all of that work and we'll -- we'll take the statement and \nwe'll gather the evidence.  But then at the end of the workday they \ncontact us and say, You know , I was talking about this with my boss or \nI was talking about it and I really don't want to do this now , and can \nwe just drop it?  So sometimes that time lag is helpful for people to \nclear their minds.  And I don't know what the statistics are on that, but \nit happens often enough that I remember it.\nSo I urge my colleagues to realize that this is -- this is \nwell-intended, but it's forcing something to happen that doesn't really \nneed to have a law created. \nThank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Reilly. \nMR. REILLY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n39yield?\nMS. WOERNER:  Certainly.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. REILLY:  Thank you, Ms. Woerner.  So when \nreading the bill it's saying assault.  Was there a specific incident that \nthe actual assault was committed and the report wasn't taken?\nMS. WOERNER:  So as I said, the genesis of this \nwas a series of conversations with emergency room nurses at a local \nhospital.  Big roundtable conversation about what's happening in the \nworkplace.  They're talking about many stories of assault; assault by \npatients, assaults by family members who are frustrated.  A lot of \ndifferent scenarios of what gave rise to the assault.  But the -- one of \nthe themes that came out of that conversation was that they felt as \nvictims that the requirement they were -- that they were hearing from \nlaw enforcement that they come to the station to give their report, that \nthey have to wait in the station until the responding officer is free -- \nbecause they can't just give it to anybody, it has to be the responding \nofficer -- that that re-victimized them.  So it wasn't a single \nexperience, it was repeated many times across this room.  I \nsubsequently spoke to a group of hospital CEOs, related that \nconversation.  And around the table they all acknowledged that that's \nwhat's happening in their hospitals as well. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  So in the -- in the language of \nthe bill it says -- of course, reiterating what was on the prior debate -- \nit says law enforcement \"shall\", right?  So it means they have to tell \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n40them.  Is there a penalty for not disclosing that? \nMS. WOERNER:  No.  There's no penalty. \nMR. REILLY:  All right.  Who's gonna monitor that?\nMS. WOERNER:  Well, I would -- I would -- I would \nhope in the leadership in the law enforcement agency and the \nleadership in the hospital would both be aware of that obligation, and \nif it -- if it fails to be -- the officer fails to provide that advice that \nsomebody will call them on it. \nMR. REILLY:  Without highlighting one specific \nagency or -- or hospital, in -- in your opinion, with the -- with your \ndiscussion with the roundtables, with the CEOs and the -- the hospital \nworkers, do you think there's, like, one specific agency that this was \nan issue with?  \nMS. WOERNER:  No. \nMR. REILLY:  There was multiple juris -- multiple \njurisdictions ? \nMS. WOERNER:  Yes. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  So when they define -- so the \nreason why I led with the was it a confirmed assault, right, is \noftentimes there's an incident where someone, the layperson says, I \nwas assaulted , right?  But under the definition of assault, there has to \nbe physical injury or pain.  And if they don't have that physical injury, \nit would be harassment.  And under the law -- under Penal Law, police \nofficers have to witness harassment to effect a summary arrest or issue \na ticket, a violation, right?  A criminal court summons.  So if that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n41didn't -- if it didn't happen in the presence of the police officer and \nwhat they're being described as an assault, truly is defined as \nharassment, would this be covered under this legislation?  \nMS. WOERNER:  It is the -- it's when the officers \nhave reason to believe that the victim was assaulted.  And I would also \nsay that the Assault 2 statute includes intent to cause physical harm. \nMR. REILLY:  So they would take an attempted -- \nattempted assault report.\nMS. WOERNER:  Assault 2 for -- for healthcare \nworkers includes intent. \nMR. REILLY:  No, no, I -- I -- I understand what -- \nwhat it is.  But you would want them to take -- so if they don't have \nphysical injury they would take a report for attempted assault?\nMS. WOERNER:  I guess so, yeah.  \nMR. REILLY:  All right.  Thank you.\nMS. WOERNER:  Thank you.\nMR. REILLY:  On the bill, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. REILLY:  So the reason why I raised that issue \n-- and my colleague who was debating earlier mentioned something \nabout having this pertain to the entire State.  When we look at police \ndepartments throughout the State, he was correct in saying that some \nare a lot busier than others.  So I want to just give you a brief scenario \nthat can happen.  Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan.  Tremendously \nbusy.  13th Precinct covers it.  Radio runs all day long.  Not \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n42necessarily all serious crimes, but they still have to respond to them.  \nAudible alarms, calls of assaults.  Possible fake calls of shots fired.  \nPossible real calls of shots fired.  They respond to the call of an assault \nat Bellevue Hospital.  The nurse says she was assaulted.  They start \ntalking to the nurse and they determine that -- so (indiscernible) Adam \nfrom the 13th Precinct responds.  They're holding 25 jobs on the \nqueue.  There's five sectors in the 13th Precinct.  They're all handling \nfive jobs at a time.  So now they go there, they interview the nurse.  \nTurns out she was slapped in the face.  There's no physical injury.  \nTechnically, under the Penal Law, it's an assault -- I mean, it's a \nharassment, not an assault.  She's saying that she was assaulted.  \nNormal everyday people characterize that as an assault.  But it's not \ntruly an assault under the law.  Police officers knowing that they are \nbacklogged, holding jobs, will often say, All right, listen.  I didn't see \nit.  There can't be an arrest on it.  Please go to the precinct, file the \nreport.  We have to go.  We're holding jobs.  That's the reality that \nhappens every single day.  I lived it.  I know it.  Could it possibly be \nlike, Hey, let me scratch out this re port.  I'll do the harassment report.  \nI'll hand it in at the end of the tour .  That's what we used to do.  Two \nminutes it takes to scratch out the report.  Everybody's happy, that's it.  \nIf it's truly an assault, the report would be taken there.  \nI think that the reason why the sponsor feels that the \nneed for this legislation is there is for a reason that's specific to one \nincident involving departments in the area.  Yes, that communication \nto those departments to clarify that we could fix this without this is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n43possible.  But I want you to know when we think about that piece \nabout \"shall\", if we tell the victims that we have to take the report here \nif it's a real assault and say it's -- they need them to come back to the \nprecinct.  The question I have is if the further investigation requires \nthat, if the victim says no because they know about this law, we're \nnow going to commit -- we're gonna now create more friction between \nthe police officers that are responding and trying to conduct that \ninvestigation and the victim.  And possibly the administrators for the \nhospital.  So there's a way that we can get to a point where this should \nbe common sense.  And I'm hoping that some of those law \nenforcement agencies may actually hear our debate here and realize, \nOh, we should have fixed this.  We can correct this.  But, I just wanted \nto give you a little take on how things happen on the street, how the \nlaw, how common folk, individuals in the public, define assault.  But \npolice officers know that an assault has to have a certain criteria; \notherwise, it's just harassment.  So, Madam Speaker, thank you for \ngiving me the time. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nRead the last section.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect on the 120th \nday.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS.

The Majority Conference is going to be in favor of this piece \nof legislation.  There may be a few that would desire to be an \nexception, they should feel free to do so at the their seat. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nThe Clerk will record the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMr. Meeks to explain his vote.\nMR. MEEKS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker for an \nopportunity to explain my vote.  I want to commend the sponsor on \nthis legislation.  I heard one of our colleagues express that some \nwould be extremely busy as it relates to law enforcement, but I just \nthink back some years ago when we were faced with a pandemic in \nthis nation and the State of New York.  While a number of us were \nable to be confined to our households, it was these nurses, these \ndoctors, those in the emergency rooms, those in a nursing facilities \nacross the State that were on the front line and put in harm's way and \nday to day they're often put in harm's way.  And I think it's our \nresponsibility as legislators to do what's in the best -- best interest and \nprotect these members of our community.  So, again, I want to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n45commend the sponsor and I will be in the affirmative.  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Meeks in the affirmative. \nMs. Walsh to explain her vote. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  So, \nwith this bill, I -- you know, I have a great deal of respect for nurses.  I \nhave a family member, my sister's a nurse and has worked for a \nnumber of years in that field.  I just -- I just feel like this bill, kind of \ngoing along with the debate that we had on the bill, I think that it's -- \nit's a little too mandatory for my taste.  I think that probably a lot of \npolice departments are already working with nurses and other \nprofessionals like that to take their statements.  I think that -- I think \nthat the way that the law is right now is sufficient and I don't think that \nthere's the real need to change it, but I say that with great respect for \nthe work that's being done.  There are lots of people that need to file \npolice reports who are busy, who are essential and I just think that if \nwe start kind of along this path, I think that, you know, it -- I think it's \nkind of a little bit of a slippery slope.  So, I'm gonna vote in the \nnegative -- I'm gonna vote in the negative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh in the \nnegative.  \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.) \nThe bill is passed. \nPage 28, Calendar No. 149, the Clerk read. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n46THE CLERK:  Assembly No. A02093-C, Rules \nReport -- Calendar No. 149, Fall, Cunningham, Bores, Santabarbara, \nAlvarez.  An act to amend the General Business Law, in relation to \nenacting the \"Consumer Protection and Automotive Transparency \nAct.\"  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation's \nbeen requested. \nMr. Fall.\nMR. FALL:  This legislation aims to mandate \ntransparency in automotive labeling, specifically focusing on the \naccurate disclosure of materials used in the interiors of automobiles.  \nThis bill seeks to prevent deceptive marketing practices that mislead \nconsumers about the composition of seating surfaces, steering wheels \nand gears, shifters in the automotive industry.  It's all about protecting \nand informing consumers. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gandolfo. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor please yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. FALL:  I yield.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you.  So, first, when we \nsay labeling, does that involve a physical label inside the vehicle?  \nMR. FALL:  No. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n47MR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.\nMR. FALL:  It would just only be on the marketing \nmaterial, including the manual of the vehicle.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So, marking materials.  \nWould that be on -- if you go to the manufacturer's website, go to the \nparticular model and you're looking at your interior options, this is \nwhere that would apply?  \nMR. FALL:  That is correct. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  What about on flyers, \nbrochures, same thing?  \nMR. FALL:  Correct.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  What about on the dealer \nside?  If a dealership has any flyers that go about maybe a promotion \nthey're running with certain packages.  Would they have to also follow \n-- if they wouldn't normally disclose the materials of the model they're \noffering, would they now have to fit that on there? \nMR. FALL:  Under this legislation, they would have \nto moving forward. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Now, in terms of \npreventing, I guess, misleading, as we're saying, materials, advertising \nof those materials.  So, if a manufacturer offers a package and says, \nthis is a leather interior, that has to be, I guess real, authentic leather; \nit can't be a vinyl PDC kind of material?  \nMR. FALL:  Correct.  That has to be very clear.  So, \nfor instance, if they are saying that there's leather in the vehicle, there \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n48has to be leather when it relates to the steering wheels, the seats, or \nany interactive surfaces. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  And would -- would that \napply to -- because there's certain leather products, like bonded \nleather, many people wouldn't necessarily consider that leather \nleather, it's kind of pressed together.  Would that fall under the -- \nwould they be able to advertise that as a leather interior?  \nMR. FALL:  They would have to disclose --\nMR. GANDOLFO:  They would have to say bonded \nleather?  \nMR. FALL:  Yes. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  And now vegan leather, \nwhich to me is a misleading term in itself - I'm not entirely sure what \nit's actually made out of, so they would have to specifically say this is \nvegan leather?  \nMR. FALL:  Correct. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Do they have to go further and \nsay what the composition of that particular material is?  \nMR. FALL:  I believe that is spelled out, but they \nwould have to list out the percentage as they're marketing it.\nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  So, there's no labeling \nthat goes -- you might have answered this, I think you did, but I just \nwant to clarify for myself, there's no physical label that would go on \nany surface of the vehicle itself, like you'd find in your shirt or in -- in \na pair of pants where it says, you know, 58 percent cotton.  This is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n49strictly on the website and the marketing materials?  \nMR. FALL:  That is correct, yes.  \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Okay.  Okay, you answered all \nof my questions.  I appreciate that.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Palmesano. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for some questions? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. FALL:  I yield.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. PALMESANO:  Thank you, Mr. Fall.  Where \ndid -- I'm just curious, where did this legislation come from?  What's \nthe genesis behind it?\nMR. FALL:  Yeah.  So there has been issues in the \npast, and there are two examples I can cite, where you had a situation \nwhere a Mercedes-Benz was advertising that they had Article Leather \nin their vehicles, but it was, in fact, genuine leather.  We all know \nArticle Leather is manmade - it's artifical, it's not real leather.  Okay.  \nHowever, they had real leather on the seating material, but not on the \ninteractive surfaces.  All right, so that's just one example.  And then \nyou had another situation where a Toyota, you know, said that they \nwere using genuine leather, but, in fact, it was either partial or faux \nleather.  So this bill would clarify that so consumers aren't misled. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n50MR. PALMESANO:  So have there been any \ncomplaints filed with the Attorney General under the General \nBusiness Law 350 for false advertising?  I know that's in statute.  \nHave -- have there been any complaints filed under that law in regards \nto this that you're aware of?\nMR. FALL:  Not that I'm aware of. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  Can you cite any data or \ndocumented cases where consumers may have suffered actual \nfinancial harm or -- as a result of possible mislabeled automotive \nmaterials?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. FALL:  Yeah, so, no data available. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  So I know the \nmanufacturers, they already disclose much of this information in their \nmanuals and websites.  So that's enough to address this?  I mean, are \nyou saying they don't put it -- this information in their data on \nwebsites?\nMR. FALL:  No, it's -- this just makes it very clear on \nthe type of materials that the manufacturers use when it comes to \ninteractive surfaces within the vehicle.  That's all it is.  Just making it \nvery transparent.\nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  Have you had an \nestimated cost to auto manufacturers that may be complying with this \n-- this labeling and marketing materials where these -- what the cost \nwould be and when that ought to be passed onto the consumer with \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n51the higher vehicle purchase?  \nMR. FALL:  Yeah.  So when this bill will go into \neffect, I believe a year after it's passed and so, it will give the \nmanufacturers enough time to update whatever marketing material \nthat they would need to update.  Originally, the bill was to take effect \nimmediately.  But this is one of those things that we took into account \nwhen we made the change. \nMR. PALMESANO:  All right.  Is this alleged \nmarketing -- misleading marketing, is it occurring at the manufacturer \nlevel, and/or the dealer level, or both?  \nMR. FALL:  Both. \nMR. PALMESANO:  All right.  So it applies to both \nbut the penalties only apply to the manufacturers, correct?  But not the \ndealer?  \nMR. FALL:  That -- that is correct.  It's on a \nmanufacturer level. \nMR. PALMESANO:  All right.  So if the \nmanufacturer is complying and maybe the dealer put something out, if \nthey violated what you're trying to do here, they would not be liable \nfrom that perspective; is that correct? \nMR. FALL:  Liability would be on the manufacturer. \nMR. PALMESANO:  So even if the manufacturer is \nmoving along -- say -- say the manufacturers puts it in the material \nand say the dealer might -- they might say, we have the sale on this \nvehicle, it's all -- it's leather, this, that, now they wouldn't -- that -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n52there wouldn't be no responsibility on the dealer; it would just be on \nthe manufacturer, even if the dealer is putting out material?  How \nwould that work?\nMR. FALL:  I think that's something we have to look \nat, for sure.\nMR. PALMESANO:  What's that?\nMR. FALL:  We have to look at that piece.\nMR. PALMESANO:  Okay.  Also, obviously auto \nsales, they happen nationwide.  So this is only gonna affect New York.  \nHow would this State level regulation interact with existing Federal \nconsumer protections and label laws under the FTC, Federal Trade \nCommission?  Isn't that kind of contradictory as far as what we have \nas a Federal law and Federal Consumer laws with this bill?  Wouldn't \nthat be a kinda contradiction and if it's just for New York, isn't that \ngoing to add a cost, or I mean, because they just have to do it for New \nYork; they're gonna have to change their manuals for New York.  If \nthey don't want to change it for all the 49 other states, how would that \nwork?  \nMR. FALL:  So, again, I mentioned this bill will take \none year into effect -- for it to be into effect, so they will have time to \ncomply with the law.  It's not going into effect immediately. \nMR. PALMESANO:  All right.  And I -- I see when I \nwas reading, that you can't use terms like leather, but you'd have to \nuse faux leather and vegan leather; is that right?  \nMR. FALL:  That's correct. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n53MR. PALMESANO:  And -- and I apologize, I \nshould know this.  I've heard of vegan diets, but what is -- what \nexactly is vegan leather?  Just -- I'm -- just out of curiosity.  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. FALL:  Yeah.  So if you look at the bill, I think \non page --  \nMR. PALMESANO:  Page 2?  \nMR. FALL:  Page 2 --\nMR. PALMESANO:  Yep.  At the bottom.\nMR. FALL:  Lines 30 -- what was it?  Lines 17-26, I \nwould say.  You know, it's very clear what the definition of leather is, \nplastic, and -- or fabric, right?  And so pretty much if a manufacturer \nis gonna use those terms, they would have to put that in their manual \nor any marketing material. \nMR. PALMESANO:  All right.  So, again, just to \nconfirm though, 49 other states, they don't have this.  So, they -- they \nhave their manuals and they (indiscernible) for their vehicles, now \nthey're gonna have to change all their manuals for the entire country?  \nOr are they just gonna have to change the manuals for New York?  \nMR. FALL:  Well, you know, New York's the \ngreatest state, so, you know, I guess they're going to have to follow \nsuit once we do this. \nMR. PALMESANO:  I appreciate your enthusiasm \nfor New York.  I wish our businesses and people leaving had the same \nenthusiasm.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n54You know, I guess my question too, I mean, we're \nfacing an affordability crisis in this State.  Is it really what the State \nLegislature -- this -- the focus on this kind of taking away from the \naffordability crisis?  I mean, you know, the push for EVs and things \nlike that are -- isn't that kind of a distraction from this?  \nMR. FALL:  No, I don't think it is.  I think this is \nabout just protecting and informing consumers so when a consumer is \ngoing to purchase the vehicle, you know, they're well aware of what \nthey're getting ready to purchase, right?  Very similar to you're going \nto buy a dress shirt and you're looking for 100 percent cotton dress \nshirt, you want to make sure that dress shirt is 100 percent cotton, \nright?  So very similar in terms of buying a vehicle with the \nappropriate materials that you're -- you're looking for. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Sure.  All right.  Thank you, \nMr. Fall, for your time.  I appreciate it.  \nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. PALMESANO:  You know, I believe, you \nknow, on the surface, this bill may sound harmless, may actually even \nseem helpful, but I think when you dig a little deeper, it just adds \nunnecessary bureaucracy, burdensome regulations and costs, they will \nall be passed on to consumers with higher prices at a time when we \nalready have an affordability crisis in the State of New York.  I think \nthis legislation is really an attempt to micromanage our auto -- \nautomakers on labeling and using terms like vegan leather, or faux \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n55leather.  And our manufacturers, let's be clear, our manufacturers in \nthe State of New York already are on a robust Federal consumer \nprotection laws.  I don't understand why this is necessary, because, \nyou know, obviously they sell auto -- autos across the country.  So you \nhave that conflicting with the Federal protection laws, I think the \nFederal Government is clear enough.  I just think this is really just \ngoing to, you know, increase compliance costs that fall on the \nconsumer.  So just to kind of sum up, you know, those points, I \nbelieve this is really just a govern -- government overreach into the \nprivate sector.  It will increase costs and that will be passed on to our \nconsumers.  It seems like this is really a solution in search of a \nproblem.  I think it also - and we can get into those terms like vegan \nleather or faux leather - it can create some opportunities for frivolous \nlaw -- lawsuits.  I think it also distracts from the real safety and \nconcerns most New York consumers are facing.  Instead of focusing \non auto safety, auto affordability, insurance reform, this bill is \nprioritizing vegan leather or faux leather.  I think we can go on and on \nabout this, where the problems are we talked about.  I just think this is \njust going to be another burden on our manufacturers.  It's not \nnecessary because the Federal Government already has strong \nconsumer protection laws and I just think, for a host of other reasons, \nalthough I do appreciate my friend's support for the bill and his \nenthusiasm, I think his intentions are in the right place.  I just think \nultimately this bill will create more problems, more confusion and \nmore cost for the consumers at a time that they don't need higher costs \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n56given the state is in an affordability crisis right now.

This is because, if they \ndie before they retire, their families do not receive their full death \nbenefits.

We need to \nprovide all the incentives we can for these professionals in Orange \nCounty to stay on the job.

Carroll, Anderson, Jackson, Mitaynes, Epstein, Lunsford, \nLasher.  An act to amend the Real Property Law, in relation to \nprohibiting rent minimums in mortgages.    \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Carroll. \nMR. R. CARROLL:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nThis bill would provide and prohibit -- prohibit any \nprovision in a mortgage that would establish a rent minimum. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh.\nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nMR. R. CARROLL:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  The sponsor yields.   \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  \nSo this bill is really kind of short.  There're just a few \nlines to it.  Seems very simple, but it would have a pretty significant \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n87impact.  Can you explain for us first kind of where the genesis of this \nbill came from?  Why you believe that this is an important bill for us \nto pass. \nMR. R. CARROLL:  Well, so, Assemblymember \nWalsh, I was reading The New York Times , where all good ideas come \nfrom, and there has been -- especially in commercial mortgages, this \nwould be for all mortgages for real property, but where this takes hold \nis really in commercial mortgages.  And oftentimes, the mortgagee \nrequires that there be a minimum amount of rent that is taken, or there \nis a penalty, or actually, default of that mortgage.  And so, in large \ncommercial buildings in Midtown Manhattan, to smaller commercial \nbuildings on main streets oftentimes the mortgagor has a rent \nminimum and he or she is then required to rent their space at X \namount per square foot and this does not allow individual businesses \nto make decisions in realtime, in ways to get new tenants and to be \ndynamic.  And so this is a pro-small business, pro-business bill and it \nwould make sure that rent minimums are no longer allowed in \nmortgage contracts in New York State. \nMS. WALSH:  Well, why are rent minimums put in \nthere to begin with?  \nMR. R. CARROLL:  I -- I think that oftentimes I \nthink mortgagees are looking to be very conservative in the way they \ndecide to lend money.  That being said, they have many tools at their \ndisposal to make sure that the mortgages that they write are protected.  \nAnd so, that -- you know, I think that this is an unnecessary barrier \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n88that stops small businesses and large businesses from making dynamic \nchanges.  This became readily apparent during the COVID-19 \npandemic when there were lots and lots of vacancies throughout our \nState in business districts in cities, both big and small, where if these \nrent minimum provisions were not in the contracts, individual owners \nof commercial space would have been able to rent out property that \nthey had -- that they had tenants who wanted to -- to lend to.\nMS. WALSH:  And I noticed in the justification \nportion of the memorandum in support, you do talk about the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, but here we are in 2025, years after the \npandemic, and yet you still believe that a bill that would make \nchanges like this is still warranted and necessary?  \nMR. R. CARROLL:  Rent minimums stop and punish \nsmall businesses from being able to go out into the market and \nactually get tenants to rent space.  This does not allow a tenant or -- or \na mortgagor suddenly to not pay their mortgage.  It doesn't allow them \nto break the terms of their mortgage.  What it does is allows them to \ngo out to the open market and make a business decision that they are \nclose to.  And so, I think it was -- it was shown to be an issue during \nCOVID-19, but it is still an issue today and that is why I've introduced \nthe bill and why I hope we pass it here today. \nMS. WALSH:  What the bill does do, though, is that \nStatewide -- not just in New York City, but Statewide, what it does is \nit looks at every single contract and mortgage already executed, \nrecorded and in effect, that contains a provision, like the one that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n89you're talking about, would be void and unenforceable as against \npublic policy.  So, just a few lines in a bill, but it -- it would have both \na retroactive and a prospective effect, correct?  \nMR. R. CARROLL:  Look, that is correct, because \neven though it does not explicitly say that it will retroactively effect \nmortgages, the fact of the matter is that if we are striking this \nprovision as against public policy, that would have the effect of that.  \nLet me just make this very clear.  These are almost exclusively in \ncommercial mortgages and it does not stop.  You know, it -- it does \nnot allow the borrower to suddenly not pay their monthly mortgage.  \nWhat it does is give the mortgagor the ability to figure out how best to \nuse his or her space and how best to collect rent, and that seems like \nthe better way, the person who is closer to it, than having a bank \ndecide to put in a -- a clause that, you know, was boilerplate that they \nput in every single commercial mortgage and put a number to it and \nthen the actual person who's trying to rent the space is encumbered \nand can't because they will either automatically default, or they will \nget a high penalty that would end up causing them probably to default. \nMS. WALSH:  Couldn't they just go back to the bank \nand renegotiate that term?  \nMR. R. CARROLL:  You know, I think that maybe if \nyou're, you know, a large financial institution or a law firm in \nMidtown Manhattan, you might have the sophistication and the ability \nto do that.  But, if you're a small strip mall, you know, on Wolf Road, \nor you have a small commercial building in Albany, I don't think \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n90you're going to have the power or the ability to do that and that's why \nwe should step in and make sure that stops.  So that individual \nbusinesspeople can go out and make these decisions and I think there \nwill be zero, you know, added liability to the -- to the mortgagees, to \nthe banks that have written these loans because, of course, you still \nown -- you still owe all of that money on your mortgage once we pass \nthis. \nMS. WALSH:  I understand.  The United States \nConstitution has a Contracts Clause in Article 1, Section 10 and that \nclause says that it prohibits states from enacting laws that impair the \nobligation of contracts.  How is this legislation not running afoul of \nthe Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution?  \nMR. R. CARROLL:  I -- I think every day in this \nHouse and throughout the years there's good case law that says -- that \nstates when it comes to a matter of public policy, are able to encumber \ncontracts and I think that this is clearly a place where we -- we stand \non firm ground to -- to do just that. \nMS. WALSH:  I appreciate your answers to my \nquestions. \nMr. Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  While I appreciate the intention -- the \ngood intention of the sponsor of this legislation to try to create better \ncontracts that will help to encourage smaller businesses to be able to \nlocate in commercial areas, I just think that this is not the right way to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n91go.  I -- I don't believe that it is constitutional.  I do think that it \nviolates the Contracts Clause and probably it will be tested, I would \nthink, if this does actually pass.  From -- from the look that I've given, \nthe Senate has got this bill in Senate Judiciary.  We know that they're \nbreaking in a couple of days; we don't even know if this is going to be \na two-House situation, or if this is just a bill that's gonna pass this \nHouse and just kind of end there for this year.  But, you know, I mean, \nthere's no question, because we say it all the time and it's been shown, \nthat New York State has the absolute worst business climate in the \nentire nation.  So, how do we make that better?  Is this the way to \nmake it better?  I -- I would say, no.  I don't think that having the State \nstep in and kind of unilaterally interfere with existing contracts \nbetween, I would say, pretty sophisticated individuals.  We're not \ntalking about residential contracts; we're talking about commercial \ncontracts.  To have the State come in and say, all right, if you -- if you \nhave an existing mortgage that's already executed, it's already been \nrecorded, it's already in effect, we're gonna -- we're gonna claw -- \nclaw into that contract and we're going to strike out as void and \nunenforceable as against public policy.  Provisions that have been put \nin and maybe -- maybe they are boilerplate, but there's an amount \nthat's put in that says, you have to at least charge no lower than this \namount.  We're going to go in and we're going to say, we don't like \nthat portion of those contracts, all the contracts, in the entire State.  \nSo, we're going reach in and we're gonna -- we're gonna just change \nthat and purportedly to help small business.  I think there's a lot of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n92ways that this State could go about helping small business -- any \nbusiness in our State.  I don't think that this is going to have any \nsignificantly positive effect for business, and I think there's a lot of \nother things that we could be doing as a Body to help small business.  \nAnd I don't think that we need -- I don't think we need this bill.  I don't \nthink it's constitutional.  I don't think it's a great idea and I think that if \nit is passed, I think that it -- it would cause a massive and possibly \nunmanageable cascade of bad consequences.  The lenders themselves \nare contractually bound to third-party lenders through a bond covenant \nand et cetera, to adhere to those terms as well. \nSo, I think for all of those reasons, I will be voting in \nthe negative on this piece of legislation, as I really believe that we all \nshould.  So, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Mr. Carroll. \nMR. R. CARROLL:  On the bill, Mr. Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  On the bill. \nMR. R. CARROLL:  Limiting borrower flexibility, \nwhether it is for commercial space or in a large apartment building, \nhurts average New Yorkers and it actually hurts both business and \ninvestment in our State.  By allowing the owners of these properties to \ngo out and charge the rents that the market will bear, that is how we \nwill help ease our housing crisis, that is how we will ease some of the \ncommercial issues we've had in downtowns throughout the State.  \nThis allows for borrower flexibility.  This is a good bill.  I hope that \nmy colleagues will vote in the affirmative, as I.  Thank you so much, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n93Mr. Speaker.  \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  You're \nwelcome, Mr. Carroll.\nMr. Steck. \nMR. STECK:  On the bill, Mr. Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  On the bill. \nMR. STECK:  So, every several years I have to \naddress a problem, which is the use of the constitution, not for what it \nmeans, but to support someone's notion of what it should mean.  \nUnfortunately, the Impairment of Obligation of Contracts Clause has a \ncompletely different purpose than what was cited here today.  The \nImpairment of Obligation of Contracts Clause prevents us as \ngovernment from void -- voiding private contracts with the State.  So, \nif we decide we don't like a contract that some construction company \nmade with the Department of Transportation, we can't pass a bill \nvoiding it.  That's what the Impairment of Contracts Clause does.  It \nhas nothing to do with the bill before this House and it is \nwell-established in constitutional law that we do have the power to \nengage in economic and social regulation.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Ms. Bailey. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for one question?  \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nMR. CARROLL:  I yield. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n94MRS. BAILEY:  Thank you very much.  \nI just have a -- I'm trying to understand.  How does \nthis relate to assignments of rents and leases on many commercial \ncontracts or commercial mortgages when an assignment of rents and \nleases is filed in conjunction with said mortgage?  \nMR. R. CARROLL:  The assignment of a rent to the \nbank?  \nMRS. BAILEY:  The assignment of rents or leases in \nReal -- Real Property Law in which the -- the mortgagee could then, \nyou know, proceed with foreclosures or whatever, or it would allow \nthem when there is a default in payment on -- on a mortgage payment \nthat they would then recoup those rents directly. \nMR. R. CARROLL:  You know, I don't believe that \nthis -- this bill does not speak to the assignment.  If I go to contract as \na borrower with a bank and I say that I am going to assign X rent to \nthe bank for X years in lieu of a mortgage payment, I -- I -- that is not \nwhat this stops.  What this stops is inside most commercial mortgages, \nthey put a minimum square foot:  I must rent, you know, $100 a \nsquare foot of -- for retail space, or for commercial office space.  I \nthen am penalized or I immediately default if I let that space for, let's \nsay, $95 a square foot.  It doesn't matter that I haven't missed a \nmortgage payment and so that -- we would void those clauses, but this \nhas nothing to do with the assignment of rent in lieu of a mortgage \npayment or in the case of default.  And this bill has nothing do with \ndefault of mortgages.  That, of course, will still govern all commercial \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n95and residential mortgages. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  Thank you.   \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Mr. Yeger. \nMR. YEGER:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. \nOn the bill, please. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  On the bill. \nMR. YEGER:  Thank you.\nMy understanding and I am a tenant, not a -- not \nlandlord and not a borrower in mortgages and not very wealthy, is that \nvery sophisticated people enter into mortgage agreements with regard \nto commercial properties.  They are doing them, generally speaking, \narm's length transactions; they negotiate in good faith.  Banks that put \nrent minimums in their mortgages are doing so to ensure no default.  \nThe banks are making a decision that they don't want to lend \nsomebody, let's say, a million dollars for a commercial property, with \na gentleman who borrowed the money, is then going to go and rent the \nproperty out for a dollar a year and then turn around to the bank and \nsay can't pay you back.  That effects the mortgage market, that effects \nthe bond market, that effects the economy in general and that effects \nthe blight that this bill is apparently intended to -- to handle.  And I \nrespectfully disagree with the notion that all good ideas come from \nThe New York Times , I don't think that's true, not in my neighborhood, \nat least, we don't think that.  \nThe Constitution was referenced several times today \non this floor and -- and the previous House where I served.  I found \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n96myself sometimes getting up and I'm not a -- not a Constitutional \nexpert by any means, but the provisions of Section 10 are pretty clear.  \nThe Government cannot interfere with a contract that was already \nentered.  If we do think this is good policy, it could be prospective for \nmortgages entered into after the date of the effectiveness of the statute.  \nBut, for us to pass a law that would then void contracts entered into, at \narm's length, between sophisticated parties, because we think it's a \ngood idea, is not a good idea and it's not constitutional and I can't vote \nfor a bill that is not constitutional in my view.  Because the oaths that \nwe took require us to say, I will uphold the Constitution of the United \nStates.  I intend to vote no on this.

GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Okay. \nThis bill would require the Department of Health to \nconduct an education and outreach program related to women's health \nand reproductive health services available in the State including but \nnot limited to preventative care, cancer screenings, access to services \nsuch as contraceptives and pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for \nSTIs and any other reproductive health condition or information \ndeemed appropriate by the Commissioner. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Ms. Walsh. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n98MS.

WALSH:  Thank you very much. \nSo, first of all, I wanted to just ask you -- so last year, \n2024, tucked in the budget was a new reproductive freedom and \nequity grant program within the Department of Health.  And that was \nintended to and I'm quoting, \"provide funding to abortion providers \nand non-profit organizations that provide or facilitate access to \nabortion care, specifically by increasing access to abortion care, \nfunding uncompensated abortion care and addressing the support \nneeds of individuals accessing abortion care.\"  So, how does this piece \nof legislation we're discussing today jive with what was passed last \nyear?  \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  So this piece of \ninformation -- this legislation is simply around providing educational \nmaterials for outreach and education for the public.  So it does not \ncreate any source of funding.  It doesn't -- it -- it will perhaps include \ninformation about the reproductive freedom and equity fund, but \nthere's no separate funding mechanism created through this.  It's \nsimply education outreach.  Actually, codifying what mostly already \nexists on the Department of Health website. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So, why -- why do we need --  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n99because I know the Department of Health already has existing a \nhealthcare and wellness education and outreach program, why do we \nneed this on top of that?\nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  This bill includes \nrequired information that has to be included.  It includes \ncontraceptives, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for STIs and \nany other reproductive health condition or information deemed \nappropriate.  Again, there is an existing website, but it really -- it \ncodifies a requirement to keep that and ensure that it's maintaining \nbest practices and keeping up-to-date with medical science. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay. \nNow, you mentioned in your explanation of the bill \nthat there were certain things that were specifically called out that \nwould be within the scope of -- I just want to get it in front of me, I'm \nsorry.  You specifically mentioned and I'm looking at page one, line \naround 8, 9, it talks specifically about access to services such as \ncontraceptives, pregnancy testing, sexually transmitted infections and \nthen it says, \"and any other reproductive health condition or \ninformation the Commissioner shall deem appropriate.\"  So, would -- \nwould you anticipate that that would include abortion services?  \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right, very good.  I mean, \nnot very good in my view, but I understand your answer. \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  It's -- it's providing \ninformation that any services that are provided in New York State, and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n100then also allowing for links to resources and how to pay for those \nservices and provide -- find providers who provide that care. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay. \nAnd how much -- I mean, this legislation sets out \nwhat it sets out, but doesn't it then, sort of, well, I'm not going to use \nthe word abdicate -- delegate authority to the Commissioner of the \nDepartment of Health to then create implementing language and \nprograms around it; is that accurate?  \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  It requires them to \nprovide information on the website and provide other materials and \nthat can include pamphlets, and you know, signage, et cetera. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right, very good.\nI think that that pretty much covers the questions that \nI had.  Thank you so much and Mr. Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay. \nSo, very briefly, this particular piece of legislation \nhas opposition because although it doesn't use the word \"abortion\" \nspecifically, it has a phrase in it \"and any other reproductive health \ncondition\" which, as the sponsor indicated, is likely to be including \nabortion.  So, there are groups and organizations that believe that the \nlanguage of the bill strongly indicates that abortion and making \nappointments for chemical abortions will be among the topics covered \nby the proposed program and it sounds as though through debate, that \nthat -- that we've established that that is going to be within the scope \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n101of it.  And for that reason -- and -- and also, there's some -- some folks \nthat really believe that this is a redundant attempt to spend taxpayer \nmoney to promote abortion. \nSo, for those reasons, there will be, I would say, \nopposition to this piece of legislation because of it.  You know, \narguably, what we -- what we passed last year through that budget bill, \nwhich was A08806-C in the budget, that established that reproductive \nfreedom and equity grant program within the DOH, that that -- that \nwent far enough and that we -- it would be redundant to also have this \nlegislation, which again, might not use the term \"abortion\" front and \ncenter, but is definitely within the scope of what the bill is looking to \ndo. \nSo, for those reasons, I'll be voting in the negative \nand I would encourage my colleagues to do the same.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Thank you, \nMs. Walsh.\nMs. Giglio. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Will the \nsponsor yield?\nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Yes. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Thank you.  \nSo, in this health education and outreach program, \nwill there also be literature and outreach and education on pro-life and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n102life centers that will educate people on how to source -- resources that \nare available to them if they decided that they wanted to keep a child \nbut they had concerns that they may not be able to afford it, or to \nafford diapers, or, you know, I -- I know that we -- I have a life center \nin my district.  So, I'm -- I'm just curious as to whether or not their \nliterature would be put out as well.  \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Well, it's not political, it's \nreally scientific information and it's built upon an existing program \nthat provides numerous information about everything from breast \ncancer, mammography, cervical cancer screening, folic acid \nsupplements, STI screening, gestational diabetes for screenings of \npregnant women.  So there's a lot of support provided in the initial bill \nthat we're adding to that provides resources and -- and information for \npregnant people. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  \nSo will one of the health education and outreach \nprograms include options for people to be able to keep a child and \nresources that are available to them for that purpose?  \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  There's resources \navailable for people who are pregnant. \nMS. GIGLIO:  But will it be part of the education and \noutreach -- \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  It's already existing in \nexisting law. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n103So if I were to call DOH and say,  I need some \nliterature , I'm pregnant and I want my options , they will send out \nboth?  \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Yes, it includes \ninformation about pregnancy counseling.\nMS. GIGLIO:  Okay.  Thank --\nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  And the full range.  I \nwant to be clear. \nMS. GIGLIO:  Thank you.   \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect on the 90th \nday.  \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  A Party vote \nhas been requested.\nMs. Walsh.\nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  As I \nmentioned earlier, the Republican Party will generally be in the \nnegative on this piece of legislation.  If there are any affirmative votes, \nthey can be cast now at the desk.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  You're \nwelcome.  \nMs. Solages. \nMS. SOLAGES:  The Majority Conference will be \nvoting in the affirmative.  Those who wish to vote in the negative can \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n104do so at their desks. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)\nMs. Gonzalez-Rojas to explain her vote. \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Thank you.  I want to \nthank the Speaker for allowing me to bring this bill forward. \nAgain, this is really an opportunity for all individuals \nto ensure that they have the proper information and resources to get \nthe healthcare that they need.  In a world where we're seeing attacks \nand erosion of reproductive rights and access to the full range of \nreproductive healthcare across the country, there's a lot of confusing \ninformation.  And in New York State where we're fighting to ensure \nthat everyone has access to the reproductive care they need, no matter \nwhat, that we are providing that information in resources available in \nmultiple languages and across the State.  \nSo I'm proudly voting in the affirmative and I hope \nmy colleagues do as well.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Ms. \nGonz\u00e1lez-Rojas in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

An act to amend the General \nBusiness Law, in relation to establishing a right of action for claims \narising out of coerced debts.  \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  On a motion by \nMs. Rosenthal, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced.\nAn explanation has been requested. \nMs. Rosenthal. \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  This -- sorry -- this bill \nestablishes procedures for victims of coerced debt to dispute such \ncoerced debt with creditors and hold their abusers liable for debts \nincurred due to abuse.  Ninety-nine percent of survivors have reported \nexperiencing economic abuse with domestic violence and 52 percent \nof survivors have coerced debt with 46 percent reporting credit \ndamage.  Survivors often do not leave abusive relationships because \nthey cannot afford to because of the coerced debit and so this bill \nestablishes procedures for them to dispute the debt and hold their \nabusers liable.\nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Mr. Mikulin.\nMR. MIKULIN:  Thank you.  Will the sponsor yield?\nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Will the \nsponsor yield?\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Yes.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n106ACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  The sponsor \nyields.  \nMR. MIKULIN:  First off, given that identity theft is \nalready defined and addressed under New York State law, is it \nnecessary to include this new legislation?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Okay.  So coerced debt and \nidentity theft are -- are different.  And there is a process for identity \ntheft victims to follow.  First, it's -- identity theft is insufficient to \naddress coerced debt.  With coerced debt the survivor is aware and \noften has to consent under duress or threats of actual harm.  With \nidentity theft most often the person who is using someone's personal \ninformation to -- to buy things, doesn't know the survivor.  So it's -- \nit's -- it's a different kind of (indiscernible). \nMR. MIKULIN:  Okay.  And -- and should creditors \nbe expected to investigate personal matters -- \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I can't -- sorry.  I can't -- I can't \nhear you.\nMR. MIKULIN:  Should creditors be expected to \ninvestigate personal matters such as spousal spending or \ndisagreements even though they lack the tools or authority to -- to do \nso?\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  You know, I'm sorry, I can't \nhear the second half.  Sorry.  \nMR. MIKULIN:  Even though they -- even though \nthey lack the tools or authority to do so?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n107(Conferencing)\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  No.  Creditors in other states \nhave the ability to investigate and -- because it's law in other states.  \nHere, when we establish this as law, they will develop procedures so \nthey can investigate and actually pursue the debt of the person who \ncreated the debt instead of the survivor. \nMR. MIKULIN:  And could forgiving debt that isn't \ndirectly connected to coercion unintentionally create a loophole or \nencourage misuse of the law?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Well, during the creditors \ndeliberation on -- on the debt there is an investigation process.  But \nsurvivors have so much to contend with and such a traumatic life, \nespecially when they try to leave their abusive situation, that they \ndon't try to slip out of things.  They have way too many things to \ncontend with in life than to pretend that it's not their debt.\nMR. MIKULIN:  And could the current language of \nthe bill allow debtors to claim economic abuse in cases where there is \nno actual coercion involved, potentially undermining creditor rights \nand -- and obligations?  And contractural obligations, I should say.  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  No, no.  That -- that -- that \nwouldn't happen.  That's not really a loophole.  That wouldn't happen.\nMR. MIKULIN:  Could someone lie and say they \nwere abused or had their identities stolen just to get out of paying a \ndebt that they really owe?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  There -- there is -- sorry.  There \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n108is an investigation by the creditor to figure out how these debts were \nincurred.  As I said, it's -- it's -- it's very rare, if it happens at all, that a \nsurvivor would lie.  And in a nationwide study, 99 percent of \nsurvivors reported experiencing economic abuse within domestic \nviolence.  And 52 percent of develop -- of domestic violence survivors \nhad coerced or fraudulent debt.  So, this is -- this is --\nMR. MIKULIN:  Okay, but -- but that doesn't --\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  -- this is a phenomenon that \nunfortunately accompanies domestic violence way too often and \nsurvivors do not try to escape by lying -- escape their debts. \nMR. MIKULIN:  Well, but I'm not talking about \nsurvivors, I'm talking about just a person in general.\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I can't -- \nMR. MIKULIN:  I'm talking about a person in \ngeneral, not necessarily survivors of domestic abuse, but somebody \njust creating this scenario to get out of a debt, not necessarily that they \nare victims -- \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Okay.  Well --\nMR. MIKULIN: -- but because this -- this bill, if I \nread it correctly, I mean, all you really have to do is -- is fill out an -- \nan affidavit, so there can be a lot of false affidavits filled out.  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I mean, if someone just made it \nup and lied and was a terrible person, the creditor would not find any \nevidence to back up the claim that this is a coerced debt. \nMR. MIKULIN:  But could this bill make harder now \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n109for honest people to borrow money if lenders get worried that they \nwont be able to get paid back?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I don't think so.  There is a \nrobust process that creditors can go through first.  They can \ninvestigate the claim.  If it's determined that it's coerced debt, then this \nbill sets out a process by which the creditor goes after the abuser who \ncreated this debt and then they can go get the debt through court and \nget paid back. \nMR. MIKULIN:  But then, why isn't this bill singly \nfocused on the violence associated with the coerced debt?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  With the what?\nMR. MIKULIN:  The violence associated with the \ncoerced debt.  Why isn't that then the sole focus of this bill?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I mean, economic abuse is a \ndifferent aspect, it goes along with domestic violence, but it's -- it's a \nwhole different aspect of this situation. \nMR. MIKULIN:  But couldn't it be that you'll be \nforgiving debt here that has nothing to do with coercion?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Well, then it's not -- I mean, \ncoerced debt is coercion.  That's -- that's the point of the investigation; \nto determine if it is coerced debt.  As in, the survivor is -- their \ninformation is used because of undue influence over a person's \nfinancial and economic behavior or decisions.  And there are many \nways that an abuser threatens, coerces, intimidates the person that they \nare in a relationship with.  And one of the ways is through forcing  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n110them to sign credit card applications, forcing them to take out loans \nunder the threat of violence and other harm.  So that is part of the \ncoercion.\nMR. MIKULIN:  Yeah, but (indiscernible) the way of \neconomic abuse and can't this include scenarios such as spousal's \nrefusal to pay for things such as household expenses or vacations?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I mean, the -- the investigation \nwill go through all of the evidence and see that.  But as I said earlier, \nit doesn't happen really that survivors who are trying to get out of a \nterrible situation, try to reestablish themselves and then they go -- they \ngo to deny the debt.  If they have debt, you know, and it's caused by \ntheir abuser, they really should not be forced to pay for it when they \nhad nothing to do with it and when it was part of the violence, the \ndomestic violence, to control and abuse their victim. \nMR. MIKULIN:  Thank you. \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  On the bill. \nMR. MIKULIN:  It seems to me that this bill does \ncreate a one-sided process with the presumption being in favor of the \ndebtor.  I -- I think that there has to be much work on this and \ntherefore I'll be in the negative.  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Mr. Bologna. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Would \nthe sponsor yield for three quick questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  Will the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n111sponsor yield?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER O'PHARROW:  The sponsor \nyields. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you very much, Ms. \nRosenthal.  \nQuestion one:  If a debt is incurred prior to the abuse \nor the -- or the coercion, is there a specific timeline in which the abuse \nor coercion has to happen to which to make that debt not applicable to \nthe victim?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. ROSENTHAL:  In order for it to be coerced \ndebt, it had to have occurred within the context of that relationship \nand that domestic violence situation. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  So if a -- if a -- if a couple would \nhave a joint credit card or, you know, they've incurred a debt like \nwhen they were okay, you know, and then something went sour after \nthat debt had occurred, that they would both still be on the hook for -- \nfor that debt, correct?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Correct. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So it has to be done -- the \ndebt itself has to be incurred because of some type of coercive act.  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Correct. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  With that in mind -- and \njust out of curiosity, could -- if it was coerced, could a mortgage be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n112considered a coerced debt?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  Let me just -- technically it \ncould.  Technically it could. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  So, I mean, that's a -- that's \na massive item that -- you're not talking about a couple thousand \ndollars in credit card debt.  I mean you could be talking about a couple \nhundred thousand dollars in -- in a mortgage.  So, in that instance, \nwhat -- what happens?  Is the bank out that -- or is the lender out that \nfunds?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I mean this bill doesn't -- \ndoesn't go into what happens down the line except it empowers \ncreditors to go after the -- the abuser, the one who created the debt.  \nWhether it is a mortgage, or whether it's, you know, a shopping spree \nat Bloomingdale's, they have the power to go after it. \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Okay.  And then my last question \nis, does this legislation or the -- does a bill, if enacted, would it \nsupersede a non-severable contract?  In other words, if -- if -- if two \npeople sign a non-severable contract where both parties are \nresponsible for the entirety of the debt, should one fall short in paying, \ndoes this still apply to both parties if this should be enacted?  \nMS. ROSENTHAL:  I mean it depends if it's a \ncoerced debt or not, and that's something the creditor would have to \nexamine and find for.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Got it.  Okay.  Thank you very \nmuch, Ms. Rosenthal.  I appreciate it. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n113MS.

ROSENTHAL:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to \nexplain my vote. \nCoerced debt is a devastating form of economic \nabuse that prevents survivors from seeking safety and causes financial \nharm long after the interpersonal relationship and the abuse ends.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n114Survivors who leave situations to try to rebuild their lives, mostly \nfrom the -- a -- a shelter, often find that they cannot move on because \nthere are many debts that they owe that were not caused by them; it \nwas part of the coerced debt economic abuse put upon them by their \nabuser.  So this bill creates a pathway out of that situation.  It -- it \nallows survivors to say, this is just another in a series of things that \nwere foisted on me and I am not responsible.   Creditors can then go \nafter the person who actually incurred the debt.  And I'd like to thank \nthe many groups and people who worked on this:  URI, Economic \nJustice Coalition, Her Justice, CAMBA and people:  Teal (phonetic), \nLauren Schuster, my Chief-of-Staff; Erica Overton, my Legislative \nDirector, Nick Perry.  I'd like to thank the Speaker for allowing this to \ngo forward so that we, in New York State, can help survivors get out \nof situations that they're trapped in and try to live a more free life \nwithout any kind of physical, emotional or economic abuse.

It's \nseven lines, but I think it has some very broad implications - \npractically and frankly, philosophically.  So I -- I would start by sort of \ngoing through with you how current law works on certificates of \nauthorization.  It's a little probably obscure for the folks back home.  I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n116have issued certificates of authorization, I've -- I've done this.  So I'll \nput it this way:  Am I correct that currently, if a candidate, other than a \njudicial candidate, wishes to run in this case, we'd be talking about \nthrough designated petitions rather than through a caucus, but if a \ncandidate wishes to run on the line of a party of which they are not an \nenrolled member, they would have to receive a certificate of \nauthorization from that political party?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  That's right.  In order to file -- in \norder to run in that party's primary, they have to receive that -- a -- a \ncandidate has to receive the authorization of that other party, unless \nthey're a member of that party. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  And the way that works is \nthey file a designated petition and then as another filing they would \nfile a certificate of acceptance and then the party would file a \ncertificate of authorization and that would put them in the primary; \nand if there is no other candidate, or not more candidates than the \nnumber of slots potentially in the general election; am I correct?  \nThat's the current --  \nMR. JACOBSON:  That's -- that's correct. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  And who issues a certificate \nof authorization?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  The committee that under the \nstatute under 6-120 Subdivision (3) is authorizing the candidate to run \nin the primary. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  And that committee is who?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n117MR. JACOBSON:  That committee would be the \ncommittee members of the jurisdiction  that the judge, candidate, or \nany candidate is running in.  There's a special provision in the -- if it's \ncitywide in the City of New York, because they have a different \nsystem, but the -- it's done by the committee by a majority vote of the \ncommittee. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  And to clarify, that is a party \ncommittee?  The folks who are elected as party committee members, \ncould be State committee members, it could be district committee \nmembers, it could be -- \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, the way it works, very \nsimply, is that if you're running for town judge and you want -- and -- \nand you happened to be enrolled as a Republican and you want to get \nanother party's Conservative, Working Families, Democratic party, \nyou want to be able run in that primary, say -- and you're not running \nfor judge, the way it stands now, that party's committee for that town \nhas to give the authorization.  If there is no committee in that town, \nthen the rules of the party will decide.  Some parties don't allow \n(indiscernible) -- some of the minor parties do not allow the local \ncommittee to make that decision and it's done on the State level, \nusually an executive committee or a State committee. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  That's also my understanding, \nbut just to be clear, is party leadership of some form depending on the \nbylaws of the particular political party or the particular jurisdiction  of \nthat political party.  It's party leadership -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n118MR. JACOBSON:  That's correct.  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  -- (indiscernible).  Okay.  \nNow -- now we establish the current law, what your (indiscernible)  if \nI'm correct, is simply striking six words in current statute -- \nMR. JACOBSON:  We're eliminating six words to \nget rid of the exception for judicial candidates or that judicial \ncandidates, if they want to run in another party's primary, have to get \nthe authorization for -- from that party.  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So then --\nMR. JACOBSON:  And the reason is -- the reason is, \nis that most of -- most voters know little or nothing about judicial \ncandidates.  They rely on the party on which -- or parties on which the \ncandidate is running, and they make the assumption that that \ncandidate shares that party's values.  And so by doing this, you're \nadding more -- you're making the process better and more transparent. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So am I correct your \nstatement was just you trust party bosses more than the primary \nvoters?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  That's what you just said.\nMR. JACOBSON:  I didn't, no.  Do you know what \nthe difference between a party boss and a party leader is?  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  What -- what -- what do you \nconsider to be the difference?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  The difference is the party leader \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n119endorsed you and the party boss endorsed your opponent.  What -- \nwhat it is is that I trust the committee to make the decision.  Individual \npeople -- I don't know if you've ever been on the committee --  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I -- I'm a party chairman in a \ncounty, actually. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Oh.  So okay, Mr. Boss. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I -- I guess I'm a boss.  Yeah.\nMR. JACOBSON:  So you know -- you know that \ncommittee people have to go out and get signatures --\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Yep.\nMR. JACOBSON:  -- and sometimes, it's -- it's \nhappen to me, had to run a primary to keep my committees \n(indiscernible). \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Sure.\nMR. JACOBSON:  So, I -- I don't believe -- I believe \nthat -- so, they are -- the people that are running for committee are \nsubject to the party --\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Yep, they are.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  -- and then they know the party \nand they can make an evaluation whether or not to give this person \nauthorization. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  But my -- my point being, the \ncurrent law is that for judicial candidates, we trust the public to make \nthe decision, the members -- the enrolled members of that political \nparty to make the decision as to who their nominee would be.  This \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n120would say, we're going to have a betting process by party leadership as \nto who we're going to let the people decide on.  I -- I would say maybe \nwe trust the public, but it sounds like you -- you have a consideration \nabout maybe ignorance of the voters.\nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  I -- I trust the public and \nthat's how I got here. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Me, too.  Yeah.\nMR. JACOBSON:  So what you want to do is, right \nnow, a judicial candidate, say the candidate is on -- has been endorsed \nby the Republican and Conservative Party, for one example.  It could \nbe Democratic, it could be Working Families, but let's say it's a \nRepublican and Conservative.  And now, they're circulating petitions \nfor the Democratic and Working Party lines.  They don't go around \nsaying, hey, voter in the Working Families Party, I want you to know \nI've been endorsed by the Republicans  and the Conservatives , but I \nam seeking your vote in the Working Families Party.  No, they come \nto the door, say I want to run, would you sign my petition?  So, it's a \nfallacy.  It's an absolute fallacy that the voters are -- are really \nknowing what they're signing in a petition process from somebody \noutside the party.  Most voters assume that if somebody comes to the \ndoor, that they are a member of the party that is there. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Now the current law has three \nexceptions.  One is for party caucuses, the idea being that the -- the \nparty sort of speaks as one at that point.  The other is for nominating \nthe candidates for the first time, which is more procedural, and this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n121exception which you are now attempting to remove.  Why do you \nthink this exception is in law?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, you have the exception for \nfirst time --\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Well, I mean this -- the one \nyou're trying to remove.  Why do you think the current law is party \nbosses can't vet judicial candidates?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Why do I think it's that?  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Yeah. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Because I think what happened \nthat, I think for -- I don't know.  I wasn't here in 1949 I believe it was \nwhen the -- this section was in.  And which is why -- it was -- it was \nsponsored by -- by Senator Wilson and Assemblymember \n(indiscernible), which is why everybody (indiscernible).  I wasn't there \nthen.  However, the reason that it was put in concerning other \ncandidates, was that they didn't want to have party raiding.  Right?  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Yep.\nMR. JACOBSON:  R-a-i-d-i-n-g, not r-a-t-i-n-g.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Yep.  I would -- I would agree \nwith that.  But there's an exception for judicial candidates.  Why do \nyou think they put an exception?\nMR. JACOBSON:  I think it was done for political \nreasons and I think what happened is the so-called party bosses that \nyou refer to, or maybe the leadership in that Republican Party that was \ncontrolling the --\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n122MR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So -- so, your supposition is --  \nMR. JACOBSON:  I'm finishing. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.\nMR. JACOBSON: -- that the leadership in the \nRepublican Party that passed that bill thought it was in their political \ninterest to let their candidates raid other parties in judicial primaries. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So your supposition is they \ngave themselves less power for political purposes.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  I said that they did it because they \nthought it was in their political interest. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  My feeling would be \nthat it had more to do with judicial independence.  Don't you worry \nthat giving party bosses veto authority over judicial candidates \nundermines judicial independence?  And in fact, would increase \npolitical polarization and undermine faith in the courts?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  This -- this will increase \nfaith in the process, because in November  the voters will know that \nthat judicial candidate shares the values of that party. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Well, if in November , now if \na candidate is on the line for a party in November , they won the \nprimary.  So, therefore, they have the faith of the people of that party \nas opposed to the faith of the party bosses.  Don't we already have the \npublic saying who should be running on their party line?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, not necessarily.  I'll give you \nan example.  In the City of Beacon which I represent, in 2019, the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n123incumbent judge who was a Republican and also had the Conservative \nline, filed for the Democratic primary and he filed for the Working \nFamilies primary. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. JACOBSON:  He lost the Democratic primary \nbut he won the Working Families Party because he got a dozen \nRepublicans to switch party into the Working Families Party.  So I \ndon't think that the rest of the Working Family [sic] Party members \nreally did -- he didn't -- he didn't -- he didn't say, you know, why he \nwas running per se in the Working Families Party and you have to \nremember, judges are limited in what they can say in a campaign.  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Sure.\nMR. JACOBSON:  That's why -- that's why having \nthe assurance that a candidate shares the values of the party is that \nmuch more important. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  But in that particular case, \ncouldn't the Democratic candidate have run as the Working Families \ncandidate, couldn't a member of the Working Families Party have run?  \nCouldn't a -- anybody else have run?  In that case, nobody else put \nthemselves forward.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  You can only be a member of one \nparty at a time.  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Well, I understand that, but \nI'm saying, you said it was a Democratic candidate.  The Democratic \ncandidate chose not to circulate Working Families (indiscernible) \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n124petitions.  Isn't that on them? \nMR. JACOBSON:  He was -- he did run in that \nprimary. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  And he lost the primary. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Yeah, he lost the primary.  \nTwelve -- a dozen people switched parties from the Republican to the \nWorking Families, which was a good political tactic which I'm sure \nother people here have advised candidates to do and I'm sure in your \nposition as a party boss you've advised candidates to do for a primary.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Listen, I -- I -- I -- I appreciate \nthat now I'm a boss, it makes me feel very powerful.  But I'm gonna go \non the bill.  Thank you very much. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I have grave concerns, even as \na party boss, about this particular bill.  And it comes from some of the \nmajor philosophical underpinnings about why this is current statute in \nthe State of New York.  I would respectfully disagree with the sponsor \nas to why this was put into law.  I don't think this was put in restricting \nthe power of party leaders to gain the system, I think it was put in \nplace because we recognize, as a State, that judges are different than \nLegislative or Executive positions.  They're supposed to be \nindependent.  We're supposed to be saying what the law is, not what it \nshould be; they're not supposed to be injecting their own philosophical \npositions into court matters.  And this is a way to insulate and protect \nthem from the allegation that, oh, you're only a judge because party \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n125boss so and so put you there.  You were put there by the people \nthrough an open process and the people of all political parties could've \nvoted for you and put you in there.  So I have that concern.  And then \njust more broadly, aren't we as a society divided enough?  Aren't we \npolarized enough?  Why do we need to inject partisanship in some -- \none of the very few places where it's not contemplated in our system?  \nI stand for keeping the system as it is, keeping party bosses like myself \nout of this particular part of the process and letting the people decide \nwho their nominee is for any particular political line, not insular party \nleaders.  \nSo I'll be voting in the negative and I encourage all \nmy colleagues to vote in the negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Ra. \nMR. RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. RA:  I -- I want to go back to something that you \nsaid to my colleague with regard to when a candidate is petitioning for \none of these ballot lines.  So I -- I -- I believe you said something to \nthe effect that the voter doesn't know what they're -- necessarily know \nwhat they're signing?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n126MR. JACOBSON:  No. I -- I said that when \nsomebody comes to the door, they general -- they assume that the \nperson's in the party.  And I -- I don't -- \nMR. RA:  Well, the -- well, the person, right, the \nperson circulating that petition either has to be in the party or -- or be \nidentifying themselves as a -- as a notary in order to be taking that \nsignature. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Right, but they -- but the -- but \nthe person that's in the judicial candidate situation, the candidate won't \n-- won't say, hey, I'm a Democrat  and I'm seeking the Conservative \nline.  That would not be a good way to get a signature and I don't think \nthe notary would say that as well.  That's what I was getting at.  \nMR. RA:  Okay.  But I -- I think if we think about \nlike -- I think we all know what a petition looks like and it has the \ninformation as to, you know, what party, obviously it's the party that \nthis individual that you're seeking their signature is an enrolled \nmember of, it has the name of a candidate, their address, all that \ninformation and it has the office being sought.  So there's a lot of \ninformation there and I don't, you know, I -- I don't think people \ngenerally sign things without having some idea of -- of what they're \nsigning.  So, presumably, if an individual came to my door and they \nsaid, I am circulating a petition for judicial candidate Bob Smith.  \nHe's seeking the Working Families Party designation.  Would you be \nwilling to sign this?  And you have now a member that's enrolled in \nthat party that makes a decision,  yes, I want Bob Smith to have the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n127opportunity to run for office on -- on this line.   So why -- I -- I don't -- \nI don't understand what the impetus is to doing this change in the law \nnow, because as my colleague said, the reason we have an exemption \nfrom judges is, I think, it takes some of the politics out with regard to \njudges who, as you said, can't -- are very limited in what they can say \nwhen in -- in the midst of a campaign. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, the person at the door will \nusually say, hey, that's great.  I'm a Working Families Party member \nand now I can get somebody to run on my line.   Now, they didn't ask \n-- they -- the average voter didn't ask, hey, is this guy -- does he \nbelieve in the party, or values?  Is he enrolled as a working family -- \nno, that -- he's just happy, goes along, he -- most of the people that -- \nthat sign petitions have signed it before and when you're in a minor \nparty, they're a very valuable commodity because, as we know, a \nsignature for a minor party, Working Families or Conservatives, say is \nworth -- it's like dog years.  It's worth eight or ten times the amount of \na signature of a Republican or a Democrat because they're very hard to \nfind.\nMR. RA:  Yes, they are.\nSo just in terms of the (indiscernible), is -- is there a \nparticular reason that this is coming forward now?  Do you feel like \nwith some of the -- and as you know, and I know you've -- you've \ncarried many bills in this area, we've made a lot of changes to our \nelection laws, I would say, in the last five or six years, right?  So is \nthere other changes that have been made that you think now \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n128necessitate this change being made, or is this an idea that's been out \nthere that you just feel like we should be doing now?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, I -- I filed this bill in 2020 \nafter the debacle that happened in the City that I represented in \nBeacon, what I -- what I gave the example of earlier.  So I thought this \nwas a way to correct that.  I never liked this.  I never liked the rating \nof -- of a party.  And I'll admit in Orange County, you know, people \ndid it on both sides of the aisle.  I never thought that was great. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Jacobson.  \nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. RA:  I -- I just want to note, you know, I just \nsaid we've done a lot of election reforms and -- and we've, I mean, we \nreally have completely overhauled the election law over the last, you \nknow, five, six years.  And the thing I find odd sometimes is that \nthere's been many bills that have come forward and what I hear is, we \ntrust the voters so much , they're so smart , we have to do everything in \nour power to -- to put our trust in the voters.   And then there's been \nbills like this and I remember a bill a few years ago that dealt with \nminor parties in terms of trying to basically allow a party boss to kick \nsomebody off a -- a line that they had won in a -- in an opportunity \nballot.  Then we -- we have those types of bills where we say, the \nvoters are too confused.  They don't understand what's going on, we \nhave to protect them from being confused.   So, I'm not sure which is it \n[sic].  Do we think all the voters in the State are -- are sharp?  And \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n129again, I don't know about you, I don't sign my name to something \nhaving no idea what I'm signing.  Usually the people who we go to \nsignatures, they're familiar with that individual who has visited them \nin the past to -- to gain their signature, so there's a level of -- of trust \nthere.  And if we have faith in the voters of our State, you know, they \nmight have to do a little bit of research and say, hey, is this person \nsomebody that shares my values?  Why am I signing to put this person \non a ballot line?\nSecondly, as my colleague said, this interjects politics \nmore into judicial offices than they already are by giving more power \nto -- to political leaders to -- to select those candidates.  And I -- I \ndon't think at a time of political polarization that is a good change for \nus to be making.  \nSo I'll be voting in the negative and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.  Thank you.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Morinello. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Thank you.  Will the sponsor \nyield for a couple of questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. JACOBSON:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Would it be fair to say that each \nindividual party has certain plant forms which enumerate what their \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n130positions are on certain issues?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  That each party does. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Would it be fair to say that if a \njudicial candidate was running on a specific line, based upon what you \nwant the change to be, that the general public could interpret that, that \nthey would support the plant form of that particular party?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  That's -- that's the assumption, \nthat they share the values.  Maybe they don't share, but that would -- \nthat would be the assumption.  But, unfortunately, judicial candidates \ncan run in the party without showing their -- that they share the values. \nMR. MORINELLO:  But the mere fact that you are \nsaying they should only run on their party line, would -- would it not \nbe a fair statement that they would share the values of that party line?\nMR. JACOBSON:  It would be a fair statement if \nthey were enrolled in that party, or if they had been endorsed or \nauthorized by another party to run in that primary. \nMR. MORINELLO:  That's what I'm saying is -- \nwhat you're saying is, a Democratic candidate can run on the \nDemocratic line without any other permissions --\nMR. JACOBSON:  Correct.\nMR. MORINELLO:  -- which would make him a \nDemocratic candidate who would be interpreted as supporting the \nplatform of the Democratic Party. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Or they share the values.  Of \ncourse, you know, judicial candidates really don't -- aren't allowed to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n131say what they believe in certain topics. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Would you also agree to the fact \nthat there are three independent branches of Government:  The \nExecutive, Judicial and the Legislative?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Yes, and it should be that way. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Okay.  So wouldn't it be a fair \nstatement to say that what you are doing is you are taking the \nLegislative branch and interpreting or injecting yourself into the \nJudiciary by forcing a candidate to look -- appear to have a position of \na certain party?\nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  What I'm doing is, is \npreventing candidates from falsely representing to the public that they \nhave the values of a party, which they don't.  \nMR. MORINELLO:  But a judicial candidate should \nnot have any values.  He should be independent; he should not take \nany positions in which you are saying is it's okay for that candidate to \ntelegraph a position to the potential voters.\nMR. JACOBSON:  That's what is done.  Because \nwhen people run for office, I mean, when you've had particularly \njudicial candidates where people really don't know them and they say, \nwell -- and they get to the ballot in November  and they say,  well, what \nparty on they on?   What line?  Okay , then I can identify with that \nparty.  Because of the limitations on what judicial candidates can say, \nthe -- what party line the person is on makes even more -- is even \nmore important. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n132MR. MORINELLO:  Well, a good judge and a good \njudicial candidate should not have any outside values.  They may have \npersonal feelings but they are not allowed.  It is against the canons of \njudicial ethics to portray any type of position either prior to or during \ntheir judiciary.  So your bill actually makes it look like they have a \nposition before.\nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  My bill says you can't be a \nphony about it and -- and run in a line that you do not share the values \nin that party, or you want to appear that you do, because some people \nwanna -- in some areas, that may be as more -- hard to for a Democrat \nto get elected.  I want to be on the Conservative line because then I'm \nportraying myself as more conservative and that might help me get \nelected. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Well, I beg to differ with you, \nokay, because I've gone through the judicial ethics courses and I sat on \nthe bench 14 years and not once were we ever told that we are allowed \nto be part of a party to show that we have predetermined positions on \nissues.  I -- I apologize, but I differ with you tremendously and your -- \nyour -- your assertion that they are falsely giving a position.  They are \ngiving a neutral position, which is the only thing they can do during a \ncampaign, prior to a campaign, or during a primary. \nMR. JACOBSON:  I agree with you that they can't \nspeak about it, but what I'm talking about is the voters.  When they \nlook at a candidate and they don't know the candidate personally, they \nwill make a determination based on the line they're on.  That's all I'm \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n133saying.  No, they cannot talk about how they would rule.  You can't \nsay you're a law and order guy, you're going to put everybody in jail, \nyou can't say anything else.  And so people make their decisions based \non either they know the person or primarily they base it on the party \nthat the person is on. \nMR. MORINELLO:  You just argued against your \nown point, sir, because what you're saying is they can only talk about \ntheir qualifications, but you're putting forth the fact that if they're part \nof a party and they tell them they're part of a party, they're given the \ninterpretation that they are following the plant form of that party.  So \nyou have just contradicted yourself in your premise. \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, I didn't.  Not that they're \nfollowing the platform where they share the values.  When voters \nmake a decision on who they're going to vote for for judge and they \ndon't know the candidate, they will say, gee, I'm -- I'm -- I'm \nregistered in party A, or B, or C, D, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna vote for \nthe candidate whose line I agree with. \nMR. MORINELLO:  All right.  So, basically, again, \nwhat you are saying is, they're going to vote for the candidate that has \nthe values or the plant form that they believe in, which is contrary to \nthe ethics of the judiciary --  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  The --\nMR. MORINELLO:  Hold on, one more second.  \nAnd you also said that they don't know the candidate.  You can put \nforth your qualifications.  And any candidate who goes into a primary \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n134that doesn't put forth their qualifications, should lose that election.  \nThat's their obligation and it's about what are my qualifications, not \nwhat party I'm in. \nMR. JACOBSON:  I understand that and in a primary \nit wouldn't make a difference, right, when you have two Republicans \nrunning against each other.  When you have -- when you have a \nprimary for judge, the judicial candidate is not saying his position -- \nhis or her positions on any of the issues.  What I am saying is, that \nvoters in November  will make a decision, if they don't know the \ncandidates, or they all seem qualified and they all look the same to \nthem, they will make a decision based on the party line.  That's all. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Well, party line would then put \nit like, good, they're gonna go the way I want it.\nOn the bill, please. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MORINELLO:  The Judiciary is an independent \nbranch of government.  It is really sad that they were trying to change \nthe rules, change the law, to make a candidate for the judiciary appear \nto have the values of a particular party.  That is against the canons of \njudicial ethics.  The only thing a judge can do, a candidate can do, is \ntalk about their background, talk about their experiences, they can't \neven talk about what party they're with.  Yes, they are registered, but \nthey cannot go out and say,  I am part of a registered party.  That \nwould be a violation of the canons of judicial ethics, and what this bill \nis doing is, it is associating a candidate with a party, which will then \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n135associate that candidate with the platform of that party, which again I \nsay is against the judicial ethics.  This would bring a judiciary or a \njudicial election down to the same as a non- judicial election.  It would \ncross over.  In an election for a non- judicial position, a candidate can \nsay anything they want, a judicial candidate.  This appears to be a \nbackdoor attempt by this Body and by this sponsor to allow the public \nto associate a candidate with a platform hoping that candidate for the \njudiciary, if they win, will vote or decide cases based upon the values \nof that particular party and not independent, because the only way a \njudge can make a decision is they take the facts and apply them to the \nlaw, irrespective of any party affiliation, irrespective of any party plant \nforms.  \nBased upon that and the fact that the judiciary should \nremain -- is and should remain an independent branch of government, \nI urge my colleagues to please do not destroy the history of the \njudiciary.  Do not destroy the sanctity of the judiciary by trying to \nmake it look like it's party politics and vote no on this bill.  Thank you \nvery much.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Pirozzolo.   \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nOriginally it was my intent really to just speak on the bill, but now I \nwould like to ask if the sponsor would yield for some questions.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n136MR. JACOBSON:  Sure. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. PIROZZOLO:  Thank you, Mr. Jacobson.  \nSo I'm fairly new at this game, I'm only here on my \nthird term.  So forgive me if maybe some of the questions I ask may \nnot have the depth of knowledge of -- of some of the party bosses that \nsurround us.  But I know that when I walk with party petitions, okay, \nwhether they're for myself and sometimes you have a party petition \nthat has tons of names on it, you know, usually, I know the people that \nI go to.  I've gone to them before, I'm walking with people, or party \npeople are walking.  Very, very rarely do candidates pull in the \nsignificant amount of signatures required.  It's usually always \nsomebody else.  So you talk about these falsehoods and I'm really \nconfused about what kind of falsehoods.  If you could give me a much \nbetter explanation of what you mean by falsehoods, because who's \nfalsely promoting these falsehoods when they go to doors and say, this \nis me, but I'm not that.   I mean, where -- where's the falsehood in all of \nthis?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Sure.  When you have somebody \nand if you're a committee person or you're running for election and \nyou're carrying all the Republicans in your area, they know you and \nthey're assuming that these are all good people and they're \nRepublicans and so forth.  When a judicial candidate or a notary \ncarries petitions in a minor party that they're not part of and they want \nto get that line, then what happens is the candidate whose -- I -- I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n137guarantee you, I guarantee you that a Working Families Party member \nwould not sign a petition if the candidate came to the door, Listen, I'm \non the Conservative line and I'd like you to sign my petition.  And \nsomebody -- for years we had the Right to Life Party and they -- they \nwanted to send a message on that so voters would think they would \nvote a certain way concerning that.  So what happens is, when a \nnonparty person who is not authorized to -- to run in a party primary \nfor a judicial spot, they're representing as if they were -- they shared \nthat party's values.  And what I'm saying is, it's not the can --  \ncandidates often want to project a certain image or value, but more \nthan that, the voters will assume, very simply, that that person shares \nthat party's values. \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  So I heard what you said and I'm \nreally gonna have to take exception to what you just said.  You \nguaranteed me that a member of the Working Families Party would \nnot let's say sign for Republican or Conservative, or maybe anyone \nelse, right?  So now you're predetermining the will of the person that \nsomeone is falsely trying to get a signature from.  Right?  You just \nguaranteed me that that wouldn't happen, but that's exactly what you \ndo.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  I said -- I said somebody on the \nConservative line.  If someone came to their door and said, I'm a \nConservative -- I'm -- I want you -- I want your signature in the \nWorking Families Party and I want you to know, I'm a Conservative \ncandidate.   I don't think that would work.  I think that a -- if a -- if a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n138Working Families Party person came to a Conservative door and said, \nhey, I'm in the Working Party's Family [sic] and -- but , I want to get \nthe Conservative line.  So , I'm trying for that.  Now, some people \nmight say,  well, I don't care , I'll sign anything.   But, I think people \nwould not do that and I don't -- I don't see candidates for Judicial \noffice broadcasting what party they're in if it's not the party whose line \nthey're seeking. \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  So now I have to say I'm a little \nbit offended twice because before you guaranteed me, but then you \nchanged what you just said to, I don't really think that that would \nhappen.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  I would say it would happen \nmost of the time, but can there be an exception to the rule?  Yeah, it \ncould be somebody who says, all right, I'll give you a chance to run. \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  Right.  But, my point is, that \nyou're predetermining the will of the voter based solely on whether a \nperson may have Conservative ties, non-Conservative ties, Republican \nties.  I mean, you've pretty much said it, not only to me twice, but to \neverybody else that you've spoken with that you're making that \npredetermination.  So we're really trying to --\nMR. JACOBSON:  No. I --\nMR. PIROZZOLO: -- the voters here.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  I didn't make a predetermination.  \nWhat I said was, when the voter in November  does not know the \ncandidate, then they'll rely on the party they're on to make a decision. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n139MR. PIROZZOLO:  Well, so that gets back to my \nopening statement which pretty much said that, I don't get all of my \nsignatures.  Particularly, judicial candidates don't get all of their \nsignatures.  So the people who sign for me and sign for you, 100% of \nthose people do not know you, right?  Maybe five percent do.  If \nyou've been around a long time, maybe ten, all right?  So I'm -- just \nthe premises that you're bringing up, I -- how do you come up to that \nbeing able to say that these people know you?  When any petition that \ngoes out, every petition that went out in this room, less than 80 \npercent of the voters or the people who sign know the candidate.  So I \nthink you're making a lot of statements that aren't backed up by data or \njustifiable . \nMR. JACOBSON:  What I am saying is, if there is \nsomebody running for town judge and he's -- and that -- they -- and \nthe voter at the door knows this candidate because that candidate \nrepresented him at a closing or in -- in Justice Court, they may know \nthe person.  So they're going to say, of course I'm going to sign for \nhim, he was my great lawyer.  But what I'm saying is, most of the \ntime, people don't know the judicial candidate.  That's all. \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  Well, I -- I -- I get it and I can't \ndisagree with you, but, you know, it's -- it's stunning how your \nstatements change from \"I can guarantee\" to \"maybe\" and then \"well, \nyou know -- \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, no, no.  It's not --\nMR. PIROZZOLO:  \"I knew the guy because he was \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n140my lawyer\".  We're not talking about a lawyer to closing; we're talking \nabout a judge, as was pointed out by some of my fellow members, that \nbeing a judicial candidate, you shouldn't have any positions \nrepresented by party.  This is the party making a decision to endorse a \ncandidate and they're just saying to their party members on that \npetition, hey, let's vote for this guy.  Would -- would you please sign \nfor this guy because he's going to represent us.   There's no \nquestioning as to the loyalty, the decisions, the party positions, the \ndecisions a judge has made in the past as to whether he's worthy to be \non that petition, it's up to the people.  Now, if you get your name on \nthe petition because the party -- or you bring your own members to the \nparty, right, at least you used to be able to, through a -- through a \nchallenge, you can bring your own people to that party, right?  So, \nyou're (indiscernible) that.\nMR. JACOBSON:  And what is your point?\nMR. PIROZZOLO:  So, I -- I don't understand \n(indiscernible).  If you want to, why don't you just change the lines on \nthe petition to say, that you know what, this is a petition of whatever \nparty and we have chosen candidate A to be our representative.  \nCandidate A is a member of whatever party right on that designation \n-- the designating petition, but we've chosen him as our candidate.  Put \nit right out there so there are no falsehoods.  No one can say.  So \ninstead of making this particular law, why don't you consider changing \nthe verbiage on all designating petitions?  It would be so much easier \nbecause it's saying specifically, you will -- you will eliminate the party \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n141boss problem, you will eliminate the uneducated voter signer -- voter \nsigner problem.  It says right on the petition:  candidate A is, I'm \ngonna use my name, Sam Pirozzolo.  He is a member of the \nRepublican Party, but the members of the Working Families Party \nwant him to be on the ballot, too.  Okay?  So, right then and there, any \nfalsehood that could possibly exist is gone.\nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, that's an interesting \nproposal.  \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  I think it's a great proposal.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  It's an interesting proposal, but in \n-- in this situation, all I'm saying is, that I think that -- I'm not saying \nthat judicial candidates can't run in another party's primary; they just \nhave to get the authorization from the party, just like you do when you \nrun on a second line. \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  No, you're not saying that.  \nYou're saying that there are falsehoods that are going on in there.  \nThat people are misrepresenting the candidate, or misrepresenting \nthemselves.  That's what you're saying.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, I said that as well.  I said a \nfew things.  \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  Well, which is it?  You've -- \nyou've -- you've said it three different ways.  You've said I guarantee \nit, most likely, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't happen.\nMR. JACOBSON:  No, no, no.  If you want to keep \nrepeating yourself, that's fine.  I'm telling you what I said, so...\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n142MR. PIROZZOLO:  I'm not repeating myself.  I'm \npointing out the fact that you're changing your statements every time \nyou're asked a very legitimate question.\nMR. JACOBSON:  I'm not changing -- I'm not \nchanging the theory of the bill. \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  All right.  Well, I think that \nwould be a good idea.\nMadam Speaker, if I may speak on the bill, please?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. PIROZZOLO:  So I think with all of the debates \nthat we had, we can see that the premise of this seems to be fluid, \nright?  We're talking about having falsehoods and people falsely \ncommitting falsehoods with -- I don't know.  I -- I -- I'm -- I'm \nconfused.  I'm tongue-tied with all the falsehoods here.  I think that a \nvery simple answer would be to, on the designating petition, name the \ncandidate, name the party the candidate is currently enrolled with and \nthen say that even though -- something to the effect that even though \nthat candidate is enrolled with the other party, he is endorsed, \nsponsored, whatever the legal -- the proper legal language would be, \nby this particular party and we're asking you for his signature because \nwe're backing this candidate.  Ends all the possible falsehoods that \nthere could possibly be. \nSo I'm gonna vote no because I believe this is a false \nbill with false premises and anything else false that I could think of.  \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n143ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Lavine. \nMR. LAVINE:  Will the sponsor yield?  I don't know \nif I -- will the sponsor yield?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?   \nMR. JACOBSON:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. LAVINE:  Thanks. \nSo, Mr. Jacobson, I had a pretty good sense that I \nunderstood this bill before all these discussions this afternoon.  But I \n-- I have a feeling that based on these discussions -- thank you, Chris.  \nThank you very much for that help.  I have a feeling that someone's \ngoing to ask me if they view this, is this going to outlaw \ncross-endorsement of judges. \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, it won't.  What it means is \nthat if a party wants to endorse someone who is not a member of that \nparty, they can authorize the party, or authorize the person to run.  \nMR. LAVINE:  And that is what this bill is all about?\nMR. JACOBSON:  Correct.\nMR. LAVINE:  All right.  And would you agree with \nme my friend, that falsely telling a falsehood is actually telling the \ntruth?  \nI have no further questions.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Durso.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n144MR. DURSO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Would \nthe sponsor yield?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Sure. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Mr. Jacobson. \nActually, Mr. Lavine actually stole my last question \nwhich was going to be does this stop any type of cross-endorsement of \ncandidates?  But, we have that answer now.  So, as for someone who \nis not politically savvy when it comes to judges and judicial \ncandidates, how is it now -- what is this changing?  So when a judicial \ncandidate goes out to get signatures or a party sends out people to get \nsignatures for a judicial candidate, they have to go under a party line, \ncorrect?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  If they want to run on a party \nline, judicial candidates can circulate for any line they want.  The \npeople who are circulating the petitions must be either a member of \nthat party or a notary that's getting those signatures. \nMR. DURSO:  Right, but only for that party line that \nthey're running on, correct?  So, and -- and really my question is and I \napologize, I should back up.  Is this only for primaries, or is this for \nthe general?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, it -- the law technically \nsays it's for the primary and that if there is no competition in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n145primary, then the person becomes the nominee of that party in \nNovember . \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So now with a \ncross-endorsement and if someone is getting a cross-endorsement, \nthey're walking around with petitions with -- what does it say on it?  If \nthey're being cross-endorsed by let's just say the Republican and \nDemocrat party, but they're going around to get petitions.  Are \nRepublican people out there walking that judicial candidate's petitions \nand it only says Republican?  And then there some -- someone else \ngoing out and getting signatures for that judicial candidate under the \nDemocrat line?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Usually, though you could have a \nnotary getting signatures for both lines. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So as of now -- the way it \nstands now, it won't come up that on -- again, if -- if you are a \nDemocrat, right, someone comes to your house and there's a \ncross-endorsed candidate, it says that candidate is running on the \nDemocrat line, correct?  Does not say Republican. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, first of all, it's a Democratic \nline.  But, no, it doesn't say that.  What it -- what -- what it says is, the \npetition says that I -- it -- it refers to the people signing (indiscernible), \nthe actual voter --\nMR. DURSO:  Right.\nMR. JACOBSON: -- and it says, I am a -- am a \ndually-enrolled member of the blank, whatever party it is -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n146MR. DURSO:  Right.\nMR. JACOBSON: -- and hereby consent to designate \n-- to designate so and so to be in the primary and they put the date of \nthe primary in there. \nMR. DURSO:  So it doesn't say that the candidate is \nrunning on a line, it's just saying that this is for the Democratic line, \ncorrect?  It doesn't say what the person is, party enrolled, or what \nthey're running for, correct?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  It didn't say when you ran \nfor Assembly either.\nMR. DURSO:  Understood.  So, in this case, and I'm \nnot trying to reinvent the wheel, but I just wanted your opinion on \nthis, because in this case, especially with people running on a judicial \nline, they're not supposed to have party opinions, right?  So if they're \nbeing elected as a judge, they're supposed to essentially sit on the \nfence.  They're just supposed to interpret the law the way it's written, \nnot by how they feel, or what their party thinks.  So, don't you think \nit'd be better for someone running as a judicial candidate to have no \nparty at all?\nMR. JACOBSON:  They're running to be on a party \nline.  If they don't want to seek a party line, they can do an \nindependent nominating petition.  A Save the Whales Party, or a -- I -- \nthat's my own phrase for those.\nMR. DURSO:  Sure.  Understood.\nMR. JACOBSON:  Or -- or you could just say, you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n147know, Nassau County Party.  And -- and you can have that as an \nindependent nominating petition.  \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.\nMR. JACOBSON:  They -- they can say I don't want \nto be on any party line. \nMR. DURSO:  But -- but we're talking about \nbasically false advertising essentially, right, in a candidate.  What \nyou're saying is if I'm a Republican running as a judicial candidate but \nI'm on the Democrat line and someone comes to your house for \nsignatures, even though I am now seeking your vote, it's -- you're \nsaying you're actually being -- I'm -- I'm being falsely presented to you \nas someone who's a Democrat and/or a Republican, depending on \nwhat house you're going to, as their candidate, correct?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, no, I didn't say as their \ncandidate.  What I'm saying is that when people come to the door for a \nsignature, right, when you come to the door, there's usually a few \npetitions, or there are a few names on there.  They assume, the voter -- \nthe enrolled voter assumes that they're all in the party.  That's what \nthey assume.  \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So do you as someone who \nwould sign a petition have the right to ask the person that is bringing \nthe petition to your home, \"what party does this person represent?\"  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Well, sure, you have the right to \ndo that. \nMR. DURSO:  So can't you just do that?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n148MR. JACOBSON:  Sure, you -- you could.  I'm just \ntalking what normally happens.  Most of that happens, people there in \n45 seconds for the person to say you signed and it's freezing and they \nwant to get out of there.  And that's what happens.  \nMR. DURSO:  Understood.  But, you, as the person \nsigning anything --\nMR. JACOBSON:  As the voter, yeah.\nMR. DURSO:  Right, sure.  As the voter, you have \nthe opportunity to ask, \"what party is this person a part of?\"  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Absolutely. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So wouldn't it be actually \neasier to just educate the public on -- that someone that may be \ncoming to your house to get signatures, that candidate may not be part \nof the party that you represent.  As opposed to really almost letting \nparty bosses decide who can run and who can't and silencing the will \nof the voter. \nMR. JACOBSON:  I'm not silencing the will of the \nvoter.  The voter can still vote. \nMR. DURSO:  But I can't come to your house and get \nsignatures if I want to run.  I may be a Republican, but I may be a \ndifferent Republican than one of my colleagues.  I want to primary \nthem, right?  Or, maybe, you have a Democrat that runs on the \nDemocrat and Conservative line.  That happens all the time, correct?  \nSo -- well, but you -- you actually stated before that nobody would \nvote for someone that had the Working Families line if you come to a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n149Republican household. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Or a Conservative.  I mean, I'm \njust saying in general.  \nMR. DURSO:  Well, no.  I'm just using the example \nyou gave.  So I know plenty of candidates and plenty of people in \nareas that I represent that run on the Democrat and Conservative line.  \nWould this prohibit them from doing that?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  I didn't catch your question at the \nend there.  \nMR. DURSO:  Would it prohibit them from running \non those lines?  Or would you have to walk into someone's house and \nsay, this person's a Democrat  running on the Conservative line ?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, they would -- they could go \nto the comit -- they could go to the committee --\nMR. DURSO:  Right.\nMR. JACOBSON:  -- in your -- say somebody is \nrunning for town judge.  They could go to the committee, the \ncommittee could endorse them, or they could just give them their \nauthorization. \nMR. DURSO:  So -- okay.  So even in a judicial race, \nwe're taking away the -- essentially the grassroots effort of people to \ngo out and get signatures on a different party line than maybe they're \nregistered and we're leaving it up to party bosses.  But isn't that what \nwe want in a judicial candidate, is someone that kinda represents all \nparties, all people, because that's what they're going to be doing?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n150What you're saying is, you don't want that.  You're saying that we only \nwant judicial candidates that represent one type of person. \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, I'm not saying that at all.  All \nI am saying is, just like you trying to get the Conservative line, say, \nyou have to get authorization to run in that party's primary. \nMR. DURSO:  Well, yes, but if I want to primary a \nRepublican, I don't have to get party bosses' approval, I just have to go \nout and get signatures. \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, because you are enrolled as a \nmember of the Republican Party.\nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So you're saying -- just the -- \nokay.  So you're saying if I am not enrolled in that party, you can't run \non that line.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  You can't run on the line unless \nthere's the authorization --\nMR. DURSO:  Right.  But you're --\nMR. JACOBSON: -- from that party. \nMR. DURSO:  But you're saying this is just for \njudicial candidates.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, I'm making judicial \ncandidates, just like other candidates, that if they want to run on a line \nthat they're not enrolled in, they have to get authorization from the \nparty. \nMR. DURSO:  Understood.  But why would we want \njudicial candidates who, again, are supposed to be in the middle and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n151see all sides, hear all sides and just follow the law, prohibit them from \nbeing able run on multiple lines to represent all people?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Because as I said, in November  \nwhen people make decisions, they generally first decide, do I know \nthis person?  If they don't know that, sometimes they decide on, you \nknow, on other matters.  Ethnicity, sometimes they make a decision or \na gender.  But most of the time what people do if they don't know the \nperson, is they decide,  well, what party is this person on?  And I share \nthe values because I've heard judicial -- they believe that each party \nhas their own judicial philosophy. \nMR. DURSO:  But isn't that against exactly the spirit \nof a judicial candidate, is we're running them as a -- as a party -- \nagain, I understand there's politics in everything.  But what we would \nhope to achieve is elect people into judicial spots that see all sides.  \nWhat you're saying with this is, we want two people to run and clearly \nhave it stated what side of the aisle they sit on and then we'll vote. \nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  All I am saying is --  \nMR. DURSO:  Well, no.  That's exactly what it says. \nMR. JACOBSON:  No.  I'm just saying is, if you \nwant to run on another line, you have to be authorized by that party to \nrun, don't -- don't have to be endorsed, you have to be authorized to \nrun.  And that in November , that voters will rest -- will then have a \nbetter -- there's a better chance and I'd say assured, that the person \nwhose been authorized and on the line, shares the values of their party, \nwhich they're making the decision.  That's how the voters make the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n152decision.  Once you -- once they say, okay, this one has been a local \njudge, this bad judge, this one's a lawyer, this one's a lawyer -- but \npeople may make decisions.  That's all I'm saying.  \nMR. DURSO:  So -- and -- and my last question for \nyou, Mr. Jacobson.  Who -- who makes that decision if they can run \non that party line or not?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Now?  \nMR. DURSO:  If your bill passes. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Oh, if the bill passes?  To run in \nanother -- on another party's line there has to -- it has to be authorized \nby the committee of that party, committee members. \nMR. DURSO:  Not -- not the people that vote and not \nthe voters and not the people that represent that party, just the -- the \nperson who's in charge of the party. \nMR. JACOBSON:  The committees will -- the voters \nwill decide in a primary. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Jacobson.\nOn the bill.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. DURSO:  Obviously there's -- there's a -- a lot of \ninformation in this bill and a lot of opinions on both sides.  I will not \nbe supporting this bill.  Again, I can't support a bill that is literally and \nfiguratively making judicial candidates political candidates.  So in that \ncase I'll be voting no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Lunsford. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n153MS.

I give \nyou permission not to face me so that everybody can -- can hear.\nMR. JACOBSON:  Okay.  I want people to hear this, \nso...  \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Currently, do judicial candidates \nrun on party lines?\nMR. JACOBSON:  Yes. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Let's say I'm a Democrat -- I'm \ngonna use Democrats as an example.  If I'm a Democrat and I want to \nrun for Family Court, do I get designated as the candidate by the \nDemocratic Party at the County Committee Caucus?\nMR. JACOBSON:  At the county what?\nMS. LUNSFORD:  At the -- does the county \ncommittee designate me as their chosen candidate in Family Court?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  The committee will endorse you \nand then once the signatures are -- the signatures will designate you to \nrun in the primary. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Would I go through the same \nprocess that an Assembly person would or county legislator would \nwith that party?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n154MR. JACOBSON:  That's correct. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  And the same for the \nRepublicans, the same for a Working Families Party member if they \nwere running their own candidate?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Correct. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Correct.  So does this bill \npoliticize the judiciary any more than it is currently politicized given \nthat we make judicial candidates run on party lines?\nMR. JACOBSON:  No. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  In a universe where I am not a \njudicial candidate and I want to seek a third-party line, I can request \nthe destination of that third-party, correct?\nMR. JACOBSON:  Right.\nMS. LUNSFORD:  And if that third-party denies me, \nwhat is my option at that point?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Your options would be to, at this \npoint, through an opportunity to ballot. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  If your bill passes, would the \njudicial candidates have an opportunity to ballot?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  They would.  \nMS. LUNSFORD:  And what does an opportunity to \nballot allow the judicial candidates to do?\nMR. JACOBSON:  The opportunity to ballot creates \na primary where -- it creates a write-in primary and the -- and that's \nwhat would happen there. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n155MS. LUNSFORD:  When presented to the voters at a \nprimary in seeking signatures for an OTB, is that process any different \nthan what a judicial candidate has to do now when presenting \nthemselves to a third-party for petition signatures?  It's effectively the \nsame thing, right?  You go walk up to the door and you get your \npetition signatures. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Right, but of course, the only \npeople being able to circulate those petitions would be a party \nmember or a notary. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Correct, and that's no different \nunder either of these two scenarios? \nMR. JACOBSON:  Correct.\nMS. LUNSFORD:  Why do we have political parties?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Why do we have political parties? \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Why do we have political parties? \nMR. JACOBSON:  We have political parties because \n-- for three reasons.  One, the parties will recruit candidates.  Second, \nis they elect candidates and third, they organize government.  That's \nwhat I learned my first week of political science class. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Would you -- would you contend \nthat the average voter does not know that this exception for judicial \ncandidates exists? \nMR. JACOBSON:  That's absolutely true. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  I know in -- in my circulation of \nvarious petitions, I find that most people don't know the difference \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n156between a surrogates judge -- a surrogates judge and a judicial -- any \nother kind of judicial candidate, correct?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  That's correct. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  So if a voter goes to the polls and \nthey see someone on the line for a political party, is it fair to say they \nmight assume that that party endorsed that candidate?\nMR. JACOBSON:  That's true. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Okay.  Under your bill, is it fair to \nsay the only difference between the current way we elect judges and \nthe way we would elect judges under this bill is the Wilson-Pakula? \nMR. JACOBSON:  That's correct.  That's the \nauthorization under 6-120, subdivision (3), that the -- that a party must \nauthorize a non-party member or someone who -- which includes \nblanks to be able to run in the primary.\nMS. LUNSFORD:  Thank you. \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  All this does is force judges into a \nsituation any one of us in this room has been.  I would love for judges \nto be truly apolitical.  I don't think they should run on political party \nlines.  I think that's silly.  I don't think we should elect judges, because \nI don't think most people know what judges do.  But this is the \nuniverse we operate in.  We hamstring judges by having them run as \nnot political candidates on party lines, make them raise money they \ncan't take with their hands, it's a preposterous system that we have.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n157But in the world that we operate in, where judges do in fact run on \nparty lines, they are already politicized.  That's how that works.  If we \nwant them to be truly apolitical, let's take them off the party lines.  I'll \nsponsor that bill.  I think that's a great idea.  But here we are where \njudges are able to wear the coat of a party they may not agree with.  \nThe idea, philosophically, that a judge could be on the WFP line and \nthe Conservative line make absolutely no sense.  Those two parties \nhave diametrically opposed positions.  But here we are, just trying to \nmake things fairer and more clear for the voter.  This is a very simple \nbill.  I don't think it changes the world and to suggest that it politicizes \nthe judiciary any more than it's currently politicized is a faux.  I'll be \nvoting in the affirmative.  Thank you.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Tague. \nMR. TAGUE:  Madam Speaker, would the sponsor \nyield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?\nMR. JACOBSON:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. TAGUE:  Thanks, Mr. Jacobson.  I'm one of \nthose party bosses you mentioned earlier. \nMR. JACOBSON:  No, no.  He mentioned party \nbosses. \nMR. TAGUE:  What's that?  That wasn't a question, \nthat was a statement, just so you know.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n158Listen, I'm going to be very brief.  I -- I don't know \nabout anybody else in here, but I am confused as all hell.  We're not \ntalking -- the only thing that we're talking about is town, village, \ncounty judges; am I correct?  \nMR. JACOBSON:  Yeah.  This -- this does not -- it's \nnot for Supreme and it's not for judges that are appointed.  It's for the \npeople that -- have to carry petitions. \nMR. TAGUE:  Now, because in the -- for Supreme \nCourt, we have conventions and the candidate's name is actually not \neven on the petition.  It's just the -- the members that are -- that are on \nthe committee for the convention -- \nMR. JACOBSON:  Right.  Just the delegates.  The \ndelegates in the convention are on a petition and they -- and they \nnominate at a convention. \nMR. TAGUE:  Now you're gonna find this strange \nbut my colleague, Ms. Lunsford, I actually agree with her on much of \nwhat she said and actually, this bill right here would be helpful in my \ncounty and any county that is particularly one party or the other, this \nbill is actually great for them.  But anyways, in my county, we do \neverything through caucus.  So, if you're a Republican and you're \ngoing to run for judge, or you're a registered Republican, you have to \ngo to the Republican committee, through the caucus process, you'd get \nyour nomination there.  Then you can run on another line, but you'd \nhave to get a Wilson-Pakula and authorization from the State Party if \nyou don't have a County Party, and then someone from that party, or \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n159somebody that's a notary has to go out and get the -- the right number \nof signatures and the signatures have to be turned in.  They -- they \nhave to be right, or you could be knocked off the ballot, as we all \nknow.  So I'm -- I'm really just wondering what your proposal does \nany different than what we're already doing?  And I know there's an \nanswer to it, but I'm -- that's when the confusion sets in.   \nMR. JACOBSON:  Okay.  What it does, very simply \nand it doesn't apply to caucuses because caucuses are -- are deemed by \ndefinition -- the reason the theory behind that is, it says -- saying that \nall the members of that party in a town are voting so they don't have to \nget the authorization.  So what this will do and what it will change, \nthat if a judicial candidate wishes to run in another party's primary, in \norder to get that party's nomination, they would have to get the \nauthorization, commonly known as a Wilson-Pakula. \nMR. TAGUE:  Okay.  So that kinda sounds similar to \nwhat I just said.  I mean and I can tell you in my own county, as the \nparty boss, I don't let any of my judge candidates get signatures \nthemselves.  I -- I -- I actually agree with what the judge said, what \nyou said.  I let the members of the party, or the committee, go out to \nget the signatures.  \nSo, again, my only concern here is the difference of \nwhat we're already doing compared to what we're not doing, and you \nknow, looking at this -- I'll be honest with you, in my home county, \nthis bill would be great for me and for my party.  That's why I'm a \nlittle concerned, you know.  And what other counties and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n160communities will this be good for the other side?  And is it -- are we \nbeing totally fair?  I guess is -- is my only question. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Are you -- are you voting for the \nbill?  \nMR. TAGUE:  I -- I don't think so.  But, I don't know, \nwe'll find out here in a couple of minutes.  \nMR. JACOBSON:  All righty.  Thank you.\nMR. TAGUE:  But, I -- I want to thank you, as \nalways, Mr. Jacobson.  \nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. TAGUE:  It's a great bill for Schoharie County, \nbut I -- I think that today I'm going to be voting with probably the \nmajority members of my conference and I'll be voting in the negative.  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Steck.\nMR. STECK:  Actually, as a practical matter, we've \nhad an experience --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Are you on the bill, \nsir?\nMR. STECK:  On the bill.  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.\nMR. STECK:  As a practical matter, we have \nwitnessed in our town exactly why this bill is necessary.  We had one \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n161judge in particular, but it was done by a large number of judges as \nwell who went around enrolling people in the minor parties who were \ntheir friends or what have you, had no relationship to the party and \nthen they would vote them by absentee ballot in the primary -- in that \nparty's primary.  In many instances, they would actually be filling out \nthe absentee ballots for the voters.  One judge had -- was doing it for \nall three parties:  Working Families, Conservative and Green.  And all \nI can say about that was, at least he had one relationship to those \nparties, his last name was in fact Green.  But what ended up \nhappening is that particular judge because of excessive partisan \nactivity, had to resign from the bench.  This bill will prevent those \nkind of shenanigans and that's why I support it.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nRead the last section.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A slow roll call has \nbeen requested.  The Clerk will record the vote.  If you are not in the \nChamber, you need to make your way to the Chamber.  You need to \nphysically be in the Chamber to record your vote.  \n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)\nMr. Bologna to explain his vote.  \nMR. BOLOGNA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nI've heard the -- the -- the term \"what normally \nhappens\", \"what -- what traditionally happens\" and -- and the sponsor \n-- I'm not sure what happens where the sponsor lives or anyone else's \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n162district but, like Mr. Tague said, this -- this bill would actually benefit \nin my neck of the woods because what we would normally have \nhappen is, very cordially, every judicial candidate in almost every \ntown that I have runs on every line.  And that has happened for years \nand it -- it keeps the optics of neutrality.  The intent of this bill has \nbeen said to depoliticize.  I'm sorry, I have run more campaigns than I \nknow what to do with for years.  This bill would do nothing but \nhyper-politicize.  Local town judiciaries , they have no business being \npoliticized.  Look, I'm not a judge, I'm not a party boss, but I have a \nparty boss in Mr. Sempolinski that I trust implicitly, I have a judge in \nJudge Morinello that I trust implicitly and both of them are telling me \nthat this is a bad idea.  This bill is a bad idea for keeping neutrality out \nof local town judiciaries .  Thank you.  I'll be voting no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Bologna in the \nnegative.\nMs. Lunsford to explain her vote.\nMS. LUNSFORD:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I \njust want to say I'm a hell yes.  Thank you.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Lunsford in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Sempolinski to explain his vote. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So, just to reiterate, I've been \na, I guess it's party boss, or party leader, we'll call it Chairman of my \nlocal county political committee for it'll be nine years here in a couple \nof months.  And so, there's nobody that stands to benefit more than me \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n163if this went through.  It's wrong.  The judiciary is different.  It is not a \nLegislative position, it is not an Executive position.  If we --  if there's \na proposal to say put judges in a non-political situation, I'd be happy to \nconsider it.  This would make politicalization worse, it would give -- \nyou either trust the people to make the decision of who's going to be \ntheir party candidate regardless of their affiliation, or you trust obscure \nparty leadership.  I trust the people and I want to keep the judiciary as \ndepoliticized as possible.  I vote no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Sempolinski in \nthe negative.  \nMs. Simon to explain her vote. \nMS. SIMON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nI am not a party boss, but I once tried to play one on \nTV.  Ha-ha.  And -- but, here's the thing.  We force judges to run on \nparty lines, and if there is no party issue, why are we doing that and \nnot just having appointed judges?  The reality is that if you are \nrunning on one line and you want to run on another line, you should \nseek permission from the other party and get what is referred to as a \nWilson-Pakula.  There's no reason for judges not to have that and I \nwill tell you that in my county when a judge runs on only one line, \nsomebody steps up on the other party and runs even though they have \nno qualifications, have no chance of running, but they run just to have \nsomebody on that line.  So we're almost forcing judges to run on all \nparty lines even though they are directly contradictory and they \nconfuse the voter by doing that.  So I think this is a good, solid bill \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n164and I think it's something that we should all get behind because if we \nconsider a judiciary to be nonpartisan, then we ought to act like it.  \nThank you.  I'll be voting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Simon in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Morinello to explain his vote. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nThroughout the debates, there's been different discussions.  Different \nmembers have tried to correct or substantiate contradictions of the \nsponsor.  There's talk about cross-endorsements; that happens in \nSupreme Court.  If a party boss refuses to give that Wilson-Pakula, \nwhat they've done is they've gamed the system.  And they talk about \nthey don't know who the candidate is.  Well, the petition is only \nallowing you to get on the ballot to be able to tell the voter who you \nare.  Judicial candidates will have palm cards, they will be able to tell \nthem their background, their education, their experience.  And what \nthis does, is it games the system.  Last year, or the year before, they \npassed a bill where election challenges could only go to certain \ndistricts and it was coincidental that those were the predominantly \nDemocratic districts.  There's another bill they're bringing in to \nincrease the judicial districts to 13, taking the 8th Judicial District and \nblowing it up and making the City of Buffalo its own judicial district.  \nBased upon what I see happening, what is transpiring in this Chamber \nand what this Body is doing to the election system for an independent \nsystem is absolutely unconscionable.  Based upon that I vote in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n165negative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Morinello in \nthe negative. \nMr. Jacobson to explain his vote. \nQuiet in the Chamber, please. \nMR. JACOBSON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, and \nthank you to my colleagues for a spirited debate. \nThis bill would eliminate the ability of a judicial \ncandidate from automatically being allowed to run in another party's \nprimary.  Judicial candidates would still have the ability to run on \nanother party's line, should they get the authorization from that party, \ncommonly known as a Wilson-Pakula, which all of us have to do if we \nare seeking a line from with -- that we are not a member of.  \nUnfortunately, most voters know little or nothing about judicial \ncandidates.  So, if they don't know the person, most of the people will \nmake the decision based on what party the candidate is running on.  \nAs I mentioned before, it's in my memo, people -- judicial candidates \nwould just circulate in any -- in any or every party's primary, with -- \nwithout regard to their own party and with voters not knowing where \nthey stand, or should I say, what their values are.  Not where they \nstand, because obviously they cannot take positions, but they will not \nknow their values.  This bill will help to restore confidence in our \nelectoral process by assuring that the judicial candidates they vote for \nin November  share the party's values that they run on.  I proudly vote \nin the affirmative. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n166ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Jacobson in the \naffirmative. \nMs. Bichotte Hermelyn to explain her vote. \nMS. BICHOTTE HERMELYN:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker, for allowing me to explain my vote. \nI am the County Chair of the largest county in the \nentire State, and I understand the purpose of this bill and why it's \nimportant.  But I do have to share that in Brooklyn it's not a one-size- \nfit-all [sic].  In the south part my district, this bill would actually hurt \nthe opportunity to continue to have judicial candidates in our party.  \nAnd we want to be really careful when we put these bills together to \nunderstand how we can carve out areas that will be beneficial in terms \nof how we elect our judicial candidates.  But I am a Democrat, and I \nrepresent, again, a -- a county that has 1.2 million Democrats.  \nAnd so for that reason I will be voting in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Bichotte \nHermelyn in the affirmative. \n(Pause)\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS.

An act to amend the Labor \nLaw, in relation to enacting the \"Trapped at Work Act.\"  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Steck.\nWe're on the debate.  Can we have quiet in the \nChamber, please?  \nMR. STECK:  Thank you very much, Madam \nSpeaker.\nThis bill arose from a situation I had with a \nconstituent who is an esthetician.  She went to beauty school, got all \nthe training she needed to do her job.  Got her first job with a \nparticular employer, and she signed an agreement saying that she \nwould pay $5,000 for being trained on the job when, in fact, there was \nno training on the job.  She decided that the job wasn't as promised.  \nShe left the job, she got sued and had to hire a lawyer to defend her \nand ended up with a $5,000 judgment . \nThis bill would prohibit employers from using these \ntypes of promissory notes, in most circumstances, as a condition of \nemployment.  Existing notes would be deemed void and penalties are \nset for violations.  Promissory provisions, also called stay or pay \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n169provisions, require employees to pay their employers back if they \nseparate from employment, often within certain time frames and \nsometimes regardless of whether their separation is voluntary or \ninvoluntary.  These provisions are included in contracts upon hire \nbetween employer and employee, and they act as a strong disincentive \nfor employees to leave their new workplace for better employment. \nThese provisions can take many forms, such as \ntraining repayment agreement provisions, or TRAPs, which is the one \nI mentioned with my constituent; educational repayment contracts, \nquit deeds, damages clauses, sign-on bonuses or other type of cash \npayments tied to mandatory stay periods. \nAccording to the Consumer Finance Protection \nBureau's Office for Consumer Populations, these types of provisions \nhave grown in prominence over the years and impose harmful \nemployer-driven debts on employees.  In their 2023 report they \nreported on TRAPs specifically.  Employers' use of TRAPs began in \nthe 1990s, particularly for higher-skilled, higher-wage positions such \nas engineers, securities brokers and airline pilots.  Still in use in those \nindustries; however, they are now also common in lower- and \nmoderate-wage industries such as in the healthcare, transportation and \nretail industries.  Commentators noted that other occupations that have \nbeen reported to use them are mechanics, hairstylists, bank workers, \nsocial workers and pilots.  \nWhile it's difficult to estimate how common TRAPs \nare across the workforce, the study by the Cornell Survey Research \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n170Institute found that nearly ten percent of American workers surveyed \nin 2020 were covered by a training repayment agreement, and the \nsteward -- Student Borrower Protection Center estimates that ma jor \nemployers rely upon TRAPs in segments of the U.S. labor market that \ncollectively employ more than one in three private-sector workers.  A \nsurvey of registered nurses conducted by National Nurses United \nshows a dramatic increase in their use; 44.8 percent of nurses have \nbeen working five years or less, and 45.3 percent who have been \nworking between six to ten years reported having being subject to a \nTRAP, as compared to 24.3 percent of those who have been working \nbetween 11 and 20 years, and 9.4 percent who have been working 21 \nyears or more.  So these type of things are on the rise. \nTo address the rise of these notes which harm \nindividual workers and labor mobility, this bill would void and \nprohibit the use of these provisions in most situations.  While certain \nexemptions are provided, this bill is a necessary move to protect \nworkers.  On a fundamental level, the relationship between employer \nand employee is already heavily slanted in the employer's favor.  An \nemployee's right to leave a workplace that is a poor fit for them is one \nof the few things an employee can do.  Also, the free movement of \nlabor is one of the cornerstones of any functional market, and \npreventing employees from leaving jobs they are not a good fit for \nharms employers as much as it harms employees.  Not only are \npromissory notes exploitative, but they also undermine workers' right \nto self-organize or to form, join or assist labor organizations.  For this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n171reason, the National Labor Relations Board issued their own opinion \non these provisions.  In 2024, they stated the following --  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you, Mr. \nSteck.\nMr. Durso. \nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Would \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. STECK:  Of course, yes. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. DURSO:  Mr. Steck, can you please repeat that \nagain?\n(Laughter)\nMR. STECK:  The staff -- the staff did such an \nexcellent job (inaudible/cross-talk) --\nMR. DURSO:  I -- I missed everything you said.\nMR. STECK:  They glorified me with all this data \nand information that I -- I'm very happy to have brought it to the \nattention of the Body. \nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Mr. Steck.  Obviously, \nunderstanding this I just wanted to get some clarity on some of the \nquestions. \nMR. STECK:  Sure. \nMR. DURSO:  So you said in the beginning this was \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n172something that happened to a constituent of yours, correct?  \nMR. STECK:  Yes.\nMR. DURSO:  How did that case work out?\nMR. STECK:  The case out worked out negatively \nfor the constituent because we don't have this law in effect. \nMR. DURSO:  They can't hear you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Steck, I need \nyou to speak into the microphone. \nMR. STECK:  Yeah, the -- the case worked out \nnegatively for the constituent.  She had to incur a lot of attorney's fees \nand got a judgment  entered against her. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So my question is, doesn't -- \nwouldn't current Labor Law already protect her from this, and why \nnot?  \nMR. STECK:  Absolutely not because there's no such \nprovision in the law.  There are general principles of common law, \nwhich is judge-made law, that talk about agreements that are in \nrestraint of trade.  But over time, in the area of non-competes -- which \nTRAPs are similar to non-competes -- those rules have been whittled \ndown.  And one of the worst things about it in this particular area is \nthe employee gets put in a position that even if an agreement is \nunlawful, a certain non-compete is unlawful, the employer sues them \nand then they've got to hire a lawyer and pay a lawyer $20,000 to \ndefend themselves.  So it's much smarter in the area of employment \nlaw to just say what the clear rules are.  And by the way, we did pass a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n173bill eliminating all non-competes, which --\nMR. DURSO:  Yes.\nMR. STECK: -- this does not do, and it ended up \nbeing vetoed by the Governor.  But that is the problem, it is not illegal \n(indiscernible) -- \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Can we have quiet \nin the Chamber, please?  Take your seats or bring your conversations \noutside.  Thank you. \nMR. STECK:  Not -- not unlawful under existing \nLabor Law.  \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So but -- and I guess it would \nreally be up to a judge, right, to determine whether or not this would \nbe engaging in unfor -- unfair labor practices which, again, obviously, \nis --  \nMR. STECK:  Not under this bill.  Not under this bill.  \nThere would be very clear rules as to when these things are allowed \nand when they are not.  Under current law, I can't even say it's up to \nthe judge because while the judge could arguably say that these type \nof agreements are in restraint of trade, as a practical matter that has \nnot occurred. \nMR. DURSO:  Okay.  So can you give me another \nexample of what employment-based debt would be?  \nMR. STECK:  Okay.  Well, one of the things that's \nmentioned often is what happens a lot with nurses now, because they \nwant nurses to stay there for, say, three years.  We're gonna pay you a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n174$10,000 bonus when you come, but if you leave you have to pay us \nback the $10 ,000.  The problem with that is it encourages litigation.  \nBecause if the nurse, if the working conditions don't turn out as \npromised and the nurse leaves, the nurse is gonna say, Well, it's true I \nsigned this payback, but you breached the contract so I don't have to \npay that -- pay it back.  So we end up in litigation.  And employment \nlitigation, generally businesses don't like it much and employees can't \ngenerally afford it.  So a far better approach is incentive \ncompensation, which would be legal under this bill.  So, for example, \nat the end of -- of two years of service you get a $5,000 bonus, at the \nend of three years of service you get another $5,000 bonus.  Perfectly \nlegal.  It's the clawback provisions that create all the problems and the \nlitigation and so forth. \nMR. DURSO:  So in other words you're saying that if \nthere is a -- a clawback provision in an employment -- in other words, \nI -- I -- excuse me, let me -- let me use an example, it's probably \nbetter.  So if I want to go to nursing school and the State is offering an \nincentive, right, because I go to a SUNY school, and I have to go work \nfor a State facility for five years once I get out of college, they will pay \na certain amount towards my student loans as long as I stay employed \nwith that State facility, county, town, whatever it may be.  Would that \nfall under this?  Because we have a lot of programs within New York \nState where we pay back tuition.  We allow for certain training and \nthere's grant programs for those.  Would any of those be now negated \nbecause of this legislation?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n175MR. STECK:  Those provisions are generally \nauthorized in separate statutes, so they would survive.  But this \nparticular -- one of the areas where this comes up is -- and the bill was \ncarefully written to allow for that because, again, the constituent that I \nhad, that was an illegitimate training.  No training was provided, in \nfact.  However, if you are actually sending an employee and you're \npaying an employee to go be trained in some particular aspect of your \nemployment the -- the -- and you're paying, you know, for the travel \nand the training, that can be recovered under this legislation.  We \nallowed for that exception. \nMR. DURSO:  So it's -- it's really more of a \nwork-based training.  So if you're working while you're training at the \nsame time.  So again, and just use the example, apprenticeship \nprograms, right?  You are working, but then at night you're going to \nschool, you're doing whatever, and you decide to leave the, you know, \nthe apprenticeship program.  They obviously -- they're not taking the \nmoney back for the training that they've given you because you we're \nworking while you were training. \nMR. STECK:  You can't insulate an employer -- or an \nemployer cannot insulate themselves from all risk.  So, for example, if \nwe hire an associate to work in our law firm, they're right out of \nschool, they don't have a lot of practical experience.  They're gonna \nget trained in some practical things by our office.  But that doesn't \nmean that we can impose on them some sort of promissory note that \nthey got to pay us back when they leave.  That's one of the risks you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n176take as an employer.  And if you want to encourage your employees to \nstay, you could either do it by providing them with a good workplace \n-- imagine that -- or, you know, you can use monetary incentives.  The \n-- the bill doesn't interfere with that. \nMR. DURSO:  It's just -- and -- and again -- and I'm \nagreeing with you, so I'm not arguing the point.  I just want more \nclarity.  It's really the more the -- the clawback provisions that are in \nthe bill to make it say that, I hire you, we do some training , we send \nyou for training, whatever.  It's to protect the employee, and the \nemployer, actually, from litigation on both sides saying, You owe me \nmoney.  I got trained this amount of time .  It's that it would be a \nseparation of services, a separation of service unless, as you said, \nthere's travel involved.  You're sending someone, whether it's \nout-of-state, you know, to a -- a plant somewhere, a -- a \nmanufacturing plant to see how it gets done to work there to be trained \nwithout them being employed.  So in other words, like a training trip.  \nYou could clawback that money, you're saying?  But if it's part of your \njob -- \nMR. STECK:  If -- if you're an employee and you're \nsent for actual training that is paid for by your employer, that would \nbe an exception.  I don't think it would be an exception if the \nemployer said to you -- Oh, I've got two places of business.  Go watch \nat the other place.  That's not really training of the type that we're \ntalking about.  We're talking about where an employer goes \nout-of-pocket and says to you, Okay, you need to learn how to use this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n177particular  chemical and you got to go to the Chemical Training \nInstitute and you -- we're gonna pay the Chemical Training Institute \nto train you, that's the type of exception we're talking about.  We're \nnot talking about go down to the -- to the Supreme Court of the State \nof New York and observe a trial. \nMR. DURSO:  Of course.  Yes, sir.  Okay.  Thank \nyou, Mr. Steck.  That's all the questions I had for you.  I appreciate it. \nMR. STECK:  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.

WALSH:  Thank you very much.  I -- I just \nwanted to pick up for a minute on that last example because I think \nthat that was getting at what my issue was.  \nMany years ago I had -- there was a -- I think -- I \nthink he was an engineer at GE in Schenectady, and he was being sent \nvery similar to your example of, like, the Chemical Institute to be \ntrained.  There was very specialized training that he was going to \nreceive that GE was investing in him to go to this school and do this.  \nOkay.  So if he went to the school -- but then he was asked to sign an \nagreement saying when he came back from the school because they \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n178invested, I don't know, $20,000 for him going to this school, he came \nback.  He agreed to work for a period of time with GE or if he left \nbefore that period of time he would need to pay back all or a portion \nor a sliding scale or whatever it was, the cost of that training.  Does \nthis bill change that?  \nMR. STECK:  No. \nMS. WALSH:  Perfect.  All right.  Thank you so \nmuch.  I appreciate it. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Angelino. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield, please?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. STECK:  Of course. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. ANGELINO:  A sad story of me getting sued \nbecause I was -- I hired a police officer from another agency.  And I \nsee in here it talks about government employees, and I'm curious.  I \nknow there's a section of the General Municipal Law that requires \nrepayment.  Does that make this null?  We don't have to worry about \nthat, or --  \nMR. STECK:  It -- it applies to all employees; \nhowever, if there is authorization -- the general principle of law is that \nthere's specific controls over the general.  So if there's a specific \nauthorization with respect to a police officer training or something of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n179that nature, that would control over the general. \nMR. ANGELINO:  And for anybody who's curious, \nthat's General Municipal Law Article 5, Section 72-c, requires the \nrepayment if -- if a police agency hires another before their -- their \nmoney's been recouped.\nThank you.  I appreciate it. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Mr. Steck to \nexplain his vote. \nMR.

The Senate bill is \nadvanced. \nAn -- an explanation has been requested.\nMs. Tapia. \nMS. TAPIA:  Thank you, Mr. [sic] Speaker. \nThis bill amends the Retirement and Social Security \nLaw to permit the beneficiaries of judges who die while in office to \nreceive pension level death benefits.  Under the current law, if a \nState-paid judge or justice dies in office, even after reaching full \nretirement eligibility, their beneficiaries receive a significant [sic] \nreduced death benefit rather than the full pension the judge would \nhave been entitled to if they had retired before death. \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Mr. -- Mr. Ra. \nMR. RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMS. TAPIA:  Yes. \nMR. RA:  Thank you.  So -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n181ACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  She yields. \nMR. RA:  Thank you.  So this is a death gamble, \nwhich I think we've done in some other areas.  I know we had one \nearlier today for a specific county workforce.  We -- I -- I believe we \ndid a bill last year that was ultimately vetoed regarding this.  But so \nessentially what we're talking about here is a judge passes away in \nservice who -- they have to be eligible for retirement, correct, but not \nhave filed retirement paperwork?  So then what happens?  That judge \ndies in service.  The family now has the opportunity to elect to either \nget a death benefit or a pension?  \nMS. TAPIA:  No.\nMR. RA:  What -- \nMS. TAPIA:  (Indiscernible).  If -- if the judge didn't \nhave -- didn't retire before dying, they don't -- they just -- they just get \nthe -- the benefit, not the pension.  \nMR. RA:  Okay.  So what -- what -- what new benefit \nis the family getting under this piece of legislation that they wouldn't \nget now?  \nMS. TAPIA:  Well, they would have the opportunity \nthat -- that -- that the -- the family will be able to get the full -- \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Ms. Tapia, could \nyou speak in the microphone? \nMS. TAPIA:  Okay.  That -- that the -- that the \nfamily, especially children, would have the benefit to -- to get the full \npension that they would have if they would -- don't do it when they \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n182were alive. \nMR. RA:  So they can get -- they can get the full \npension. \nMS. TAPIA:  Yes. \nMR. RA:  Now, I assume it would be based on \nwhatever beneficiary the -- the judge had designated with the \nretirement system?  \nMS. TAPIA:  Yes, the children or the husband.  Yes.\nMR. RA:  Okay.  The children or a spouse.\nMS. TAPIA:  Or spouse, yes. \nMR. RA:  And then -- and so it would be -- because \nobviously sometime -- sometimes even if you're, right, if you're \ncollecting a pension they're -- they have that survivability.  So then \nthat beneficiary would get it for the remainder of their life \n(indiscernible), correct?  \nMS. TAPIA:  Yes.  Like, they will have it if that \nhappened. \nMR. RA:  Thank you.\nNow as opposed to current law, really all that would \nhappen was the -- would -- the family would be eligible for the death \nbenefit that we're familiar with, which like for -- for us I believe it's \nthree times our salary and it's a one-time thing and that's it. \nMS. TAPIA:  That's correct. \nMR. RA:  So that -- currently, that's all they would be \nentitled to, correct?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n183MS. TAPIA:  Correct. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  Thank you.\nAnd this would apply to State-paid judges.  So is that \njust Supreme Court, you know, Court of Claims?  \nMS. TAPIA:  All of them. \nMR. RA:  What about local judges, county judges, \ndistrict judges?  \nMS. TAPIA:  I think -- I mean, the -- \n(Conferencing)\nOkay.  Judges -- judge or justice of the Unified Court \nSystem, including a retired judge of the Court of Appeals or retired \njustice of the Supreme Court who is serving as a justice of the \nSupreme Court pursuant to certification by the administrative, yes. \nMR. RA:  Okay.  And have we in -- because last -- \nlast time, the Governor said that the costs were not accounted for.  Is \nthere something different that would enable the Governor to now sign \nthis and not have that concern? \nMS. TAPIA:  Yes.  The Unified Court System are \n[sic] responsible for -- to put all the funds that are needed for that, \nwhich is -- I have it here -- what is it?  Hold on.  No, I have it here.  \nSomeplace written.  Maybe here?  Hold on, hold on.  I'm looking for \nthat.  Okay.  Exactly.  They are -- the United [sic] Court System has \nconfirmed it can fully absorb the cost within its current budget, which \nis one-time cost of $4.85 million, and then the annual recovering cost \nof 287,000.  So it's not gonna be any extra funds put by the State. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n184MR. RA:  Okay.  Thank you.  I think that's all I have \nin terms of questions.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  On the bill. \nMR. RA:  So I -- I just want to mention, you know, \nwe've done this before.  Like I said earlier today, we passed a bill that \nis very limited in scope.  But this is an issue that impacts all public \nemployees, and it seems to me at some point we have to either make a \ndecision that something like this is going to be available to everybody \nor -- or nobody.  The -- you know, to do this -- it's been talked a lot \nabout doing this for our corrections officers who are in a situation \nwhere there is a tremendous lack of officers.  They can't hire, they \ncan't keep people.  And something like this would protect those \nindividuals who want to stay in service once they've reached the point \nthat they could otherwise retire.  These are difficult decisions that -- \nthat people make after years of government service, because they risk \n-- and that's why -- you know, that's why it's called a death gamble -- \nthey risk that if they die in service, that pension they have earned dies \nwith them and their family doesn't -- doesn't get it.  So I -- I certainly \nunderstand why we would want to do this.  But I think there are many, \nmany other public employees that if we're going to make this type of \nchange, need to have this available to them much more so than -- than \njudges.  Many times judges are -- are in a situation where, you know, \nyou -- you leave and -- and retire, there's plenty of law firms looking \nto hire them.  There's -- there's plenty of places for them to go.  So I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n185think it's a very different situation then, say, a corrections officer or \nsome other State employee.  But -- but again, I think we need to think \nabout this more holistically in terms of pensions and public employees \nthan doing this piecemeal approach that we're saying, okay, we're \ngonna do this for judges or -- or we're gonna do it for -- for some other \nsector. \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Read the last \nsection. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMs. Tapia to explain her vote. \nMS. TAPIA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOur judges day in and day out protect our people and \nour democracy.  This bill fixes sometime -- something deeply unfair to \nthem.  It is called the death gamble.  If a State-paid judge dies one day \nbefore filing for retirement, their family receives only a basic lump \nsum death benefit, often far less than the -- than the pension they \nearned through decades of service.  Had that same judge retired 24 \nhours earlier, their spouse or child will be taken care of with a full \npension benefit.  \nIn one notable case, matter of O'Brien v. Tremaine , \nwhich sparked this conversation, the widow of a judge who died only \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n186six days before his retirement was denied pension benefits and given a \nmeager lump sum death benefit.  That's the gamble, and it's wrong. \nThe -- the corrected -- we corrected the justice for -- \nthe injustice for teachers, police officers and firefighters back in 2000.  \nBut we left our judges out.  Judges who often enter public service later \nin life.  Judges whose experience we want on the bench, but who feel \nforced to retire early to protect the families from this exact scenario.  \nThis bill -- \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Thank you, Ms. \nTapia.  How do you vote?  \nMS. TAPIA:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  How do you vote?  \nMS. TAPIA:  In the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Thank you.  Ms. -- \nMs. Tapia in the affirmative.\nMr. Palmesano to explain his vote. \nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes, Madam Speaker, my \ncolleagues.  \nEarlier today we voted to pass the death gamble for \ncounty corrections officers, now we're passing the death gamble for \njudges.  I -- I and many of my colleagues anxiously await for the \nMajority to bring up the bill that will pass the death gamble for our \nState corrections officers.  We've passed it twice, the Governor's \nvetoed it twice, said we want to put it in the budget.  It never gets put \nin the budget.  I think we need to send a strong message to the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n187Governor this is a priority.  We should pass it.  Our corrections \nofficers have a very difficult and dangerous job.  There's a tremendous \nstaffing shortage because of quality of life issues, because of safety \nissues inside our correctional facilities.  These individuals, it's a 25- \nyear retirement.  Some of them decide to stay beyond 25 years, as we \nwere talking about with the premise of the bill.  But if they die while \nin service and still working, their family would only get three times \ntheir annual salary.  We need to protect that pension for their families.  \nNumber one, they deserve it.  Number two, the spouses, those COs \nearned it.  So it's up to us to help ensure that their family members get \nthat benefit that they're entitled to, that they deserve and they've \nearned.  It's the right thing to do.  And let's send a message to the \nGovernor, this is a priority.  And -- and if she vetoes it again -- here's a \nnovel idea -- it passes unanimously, let's bring it up and override the \nGovernor's veto.  We're an equal partner.  That's our legislative \nresponsibility.  Why do we just have to accept her vetoes and then go \non to the next thing.\nSo let's pass it.  Again, do the right thing, and if the \nGovernor wants to veto it, if she's not gonna put it in her budget, then \nwe should override it.\nSo I will vote for this legislation, but I encourage us \nto quickly bring with the remaining days bring up the -- the death \ngamble bill for our State corrections officers who deserve it and have \nearned it.\nThank you. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n188ACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Mr. Palmesano in \nthe affirmative.   \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Madam Speaker, as we \ncontinue our floor work on debate we are going to go to Rules Report \nNo. 544 by Mr. Hevesi, Rules Report No. 550 by Mr. Anderson.

An \nact to amend the Social Services Law, in relation to the establishment \nof a Statewide supervised visitation initiative to support safe and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n189structured parenting time.  \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Hevesi.\nMR. HEVESI:  Good evening, Madam Speaker and \ncolleagues, Ms. Walsh.  \nThis bill will establish a Statewide supervised \nvisitation initiative to support safe and structured parenting time in \nNew York State. \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, will the sponsor \nyield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER ROMERO:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  I have a lot of \nthem, to be honest with you. \nMR. HEVESI:  Okay. \nMS. WALSH:  First of all, I just want to say from the \nbeginning that there's no doubt that there is just a, like, a dearth of \nopportunities for supervised visitation --\nMR. HEVESI:  Agreed.\nMS. WALSH:  -- in the family court system, certainly \nthe county that I practice in.  And so I don't -- I don't question the -- \nthe desire to provide some services here because somewhere along the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n190way, the churches that used to provide it, the not-for-profits that used \nto provide it, they've -- the for-profit ones that used to provide it, \nthey've all dried up, at -- at least in the counties that I'm familiar with.  \nSo let -- I want to start from there, you know, and then just take a look \nat really what this bill does and why -- why I believe that this bill, \nwhile it has the very best of intentions, I -- I don't think is ready.  I --\nMR. HEVESI:  Oh, okay.\nMS. WALSH:  -- don't think it's ready.  And I'll -- \nwe'll --\nMR. HEVESI:  (Indiscernible)\nMS. WALSH:  We'll get to that.   \nMR. HEVESI:  Great. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So the bill requires the Office \nof Victim Services, in consultation with the Office for the -- for the \nPrevention of Domestic Violence, to establish a Statewide supervised \nvisitation initiative.  I guess first question is, why are -- why is it being \nrun through those two offices?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Well, if I can, I'm gonna just take a \nlittle liberty and take a step back.  You're right about the dearth.  I'll \ndo it very quickly.\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMR. HEVESI:  But in 2023 the Office of Court \nAdministration did an analysis of how many supervised visitation \nproviders we have in New York State and found that 28 of our \ncounties have zero.  New York City has three, which can \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n191accommodate about 850 of these arrangements when they need to be \ndoing somewhere in the neighborhood of 8- or 9,000 because they're \nhalf the State, and then even the ones we have up and running, it's \ncost-prohibitive and there are huge wait lists.  So that's why we're \nhere.  \nMS. WALSH:  Absolutely.  I -- you're not gonna get \nany argument from me on that at all. \nMR. HEVESI:  Perfect.  Thank you.\nAs to your question, these seem like the logical \nentities to run it through the Office of Victim Services, because you're \ndealing with families that are separated primarily from either family \nviolence or child protective cases.  So I think that's why we made that \nchoice. \nMS. WALSH:  Well, what about just run-of-the-mill \nfamily court cases where you've got allegations that have been brought \ninto just a regular, you know, Article 6 family court case that -- where \nthere is some domestic violence or there is some mental illness or \nthere's some -- maybe it doesn't rise to the level where you've got a -- \nan Article 10 abuse or neglect case.  But, you know -- or maybe it's \nnot even an IDV, or integrated domestic violence court, but you've got \nsome allegations and you may need some supervision.  Would those \ncases and those kids come under this program as well?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely.  Any -- any court-ordered \nsupervised visit -- professional supervised visitation is -- will be \ncovered under this bill. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n192MS. WALSH:  So any time the court orders it?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.  And -- and part of the reason \n-- so there's multiple problems with having a lack of supervised \nvisitation.  One of them is -- well, I'll give you two; one is the court \ndoesn't get the reports on the evaluation of the relationship between \nthe parent and the child, which is a problem.  I'm sorry, I just lost my \ntrain of thought. \nMS. WALSH:  As far as accountability, there's gonna \nbe --\nMR. HEVESI:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nMS. WALSH:  -- there's gonna be a lot of oversight \nin reporting on the -- in each visit, right? \nMR. HEVESI:  Exactly.  That's right.  And forgive \nme, one other thing.\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMR. HEVESI:  This is the point I just lost.  Because \nyou don't have significant supervised visitation, when the court orders \nthe family to go have supervised visitation they come back frequently \nnot having had it, which delays the court process.  This is a part and \nparcel to the family court being delayed.  \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, right.  So, I mean, what \nhappens sometimes is the -- the -- the parents are warring, right?  \nThey're warring, they come into court and they say, you know, I don't \ntrust my spouse  or I don't trust , you know, my -- the father of my child \nto have unsupervised visits with -- with that child.  And I want that to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n193be supervised .  And then the court says, Great.  Who do you have to \nsupervise?   Well, you know, the -- the dad or -- you know, the dad \nsays, Well, I've got this person, this person or this person.  I don't like \nany of those people.  I want it to be supervised.  I want it to be \nsupervised by the court.  And I don't like -- Well , why don't you like \nthose people?  Well, that one likes that person too much and they \nwon't call.  You know , they won't stop a visit if it gets inappropriate , \nor, I don't like them because , you know, they were mean to me last \nChristmas .  I mean, it could be -- we hear all kinds of things.\nMR. HEVESI:  I'm sure.\nMS. WALSH:  So if for some reason those people's \nnames that have been thrown up as possible supervisors don't meet the \nrequirements of the other litigant or the claimant, then the family court \ncould say, All right, then it's gonna be supervised visits then  and then \nit would fall under this. \nMR. HEVESI:  That's exactly right.  And I -- in my -- \nI don't practice in the way that you have, so you understand the system \nbetter than I do.  But I think that's a common occurrence. \nMS. WALSH:  It is --\nMR. HEVESI:  It just --\nMS. WALSH:  -- extremely common.\nMR. HEVESI:  Exactly.\nMS. WALSH:  That is -- that is part of my concern \nwith the bill, is that you're -- you're talking about -- I mean, given a \nchoice anybody, I would say, I can't think of an instance where \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n194somebody would come before family court and say, You know , I really \nthink that my -- my mother could act as a supervisor and would be \ncapable or my , you know, neighbor .  They -- they want to have State \nor -- or neutral, they would think it was neutral --\nMR. HEVESI:  Yes, that's perfect.  (Indiscernible/ \ncross-talk).\nMS. WALSH:  -- supervision.  And so what I'm \nsaying is that the cost of this is going to be astronomical, in my view. \nMR. HEVESI:  Okay.  So let me talk about cost.  So I \n-- so I appreciate that.  We believe it's $25 million. \nMS. WALSH:  $25 million?\nMR. HEVESI:  $25 million.\nMS. WALSH:  Statewide?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Statewide, annually.  Yeah.  And I \ncan break it down for you. \nMS. WALSH:  I -- okay. \nMR. HEVESI:  That's the -- that's the numbers we got \nfrom the Office of Court Administration, $25 million annually.  And \nwhat you get from that -- and I just want to make sure that we all \nunderstand what we're doing here.  So this is where you were leading, \nMs. Walsh.  I'm just gonna follow up. \nSo the Office of Victim Services, in consultation with \nthe Office of People with Domestic Violence [sic], is gonna fund one \nprogram per county and expand existing programs.  So if there's \ncounties on the ground, we're gonna expand.  We're also gonna allow \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n195counties, if they're geographically appropriate, to share one of these if \nit's -- if it's too much of an onerous thing on the counties to -- to do \ntheir own.  But we're requiring something.  We're -- we're mandating \nsomething from the counties as well.  So we're gonna ask the counties \nto give us an analysis in their districtwide child welfare services plan.  \nWe're gonna need an assessment of four things:  Their local needs, \ntheir program plans, their usage data, and their projected cost.  And \nthen here's what the State gets out of it:  The State is gonna make \nthese programs comply with court orders, and then they're also -- the \nState is gonna make these programs offer free waivers for low-income \nfamilies, and then provide the reports to O -- O -- OVS as directed.  \nSo this money, I would argue, is incredibly well-spent for a couple \nreasons; first, it helps the court system, but let me go back to what it \ndoes for kids.  So first -- and you know this -- first --  \nMS. WALSH:  It gives them safe supervision.  I \nmean, I understand the reason for it.  I -- I wanna -- can I just hone in \nfor a moment on the --  \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely. \nMS. WALSH:  -- on the cost, which I think is \nincredibly lowball, in my view.\nMR. HEVESI:  Okay.\nMS. WALSH:  I really do.  And -- and I wanna get to \nthe point where it's saying in here that it's gonna be using available \ngrant funding to support safe and structured parenting time.  Do you \nhave any grant money out there that you know of?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n196MR. HEVESI:  No.  We're gonna be doing this is in \nthis future budget.  Upcoming budget. \nMS. WALSH:  So, we would be passing this bill -- \nhas it -- has this passed the Senate?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Not yet. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So if this bill got done, then \nthe idea would be, like, next April there would be -- there would be \nsome kind of a budget line?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Yes, that's what we're hoping for. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So do you know how well the \n-- did you say that there were 28 -- how many programs are there \ncurrently running out of the 62 counties, 20, was it?  \nMR. HEVESI:  So, I've got to do my math.  Last I \nwas told it was 28 that don't have it, minus 62. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right.  Because I thought it \nsaid in there -- maybe I misread your memo of support.  I thought that \nthere were -- I thought that there were 20 who did have it.  I -- which \nsounded about right to me. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah, no, 28 counties, my \nunderstanding that do not have it at all.\nMS. WALSH:  Twenty-eight don't have it?  How \nmany do have it?\nMR. HEVESI:  That's my understanding.  I'll check, \nbut I believe that's the number. \nMS. WALSH:  Twenty -- oh, 20 counties -- oh, now \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n197it's 28.  Okay.  Well, probably more folded then.  Yeah, I'm looking at \nyour justification . \nMR. HEVESI:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk) it's not a \ngood model, right?  So these are professional supervised visitation.  \nFor them to stay in business they have to charge a -- a significant \namount.  The cheapest that we found is about $75 per one hour.  So if \nyou do that, you want an hour with your kid a week, that's $75 times \nfour, you're at $300 in a week.  The people who need this, that's \ncost-prohibitive.  And here's the problem --\nMS. WALSH:  Is it gonna be means tested at all?  \nMR. HEVESI:  What's that?\nMS. WALSH:  Is it going to be means tested at all?\nMR. HEVESI:  Yes, absolutely.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. HEVESI:  What they're gonna do is do an \nanalysis of these low-income families and say, Listen, you're -- you \nwould be precluded under normal circumstances from getting \nsupervised visitation, but we're gonna help you with those funds.  And \n-- and let me just touch on one other thing -- \nMS. WALSH:  Sure.  \nMR. HEVESI:  -- and this is -- let me see if you agree \nor not.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. HEVESI:  We're avoiding -- for me, this 25 \nmillion is the best-spent money you could possibly put together.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n198Because what you're allowing is kids to maintain their connection \nwith their parents.  Now, number one, parents have a fundamental \nright to raise their kids, to -- to choose their education, all of the other \nrights that are -- come out of the 14th Amendment -- of the Due \nProcess Clause of the 14th Amendment.  So that's for parents.  \nNumber two, even in circumstances where there's abuse or violence or \nthe worst possible things, having contact with your parent is \nexceptionally important for these kids in their development.  \nOtherwise, you're leaving kids the experience of being away from \nyour parents.  Family separation is a trauma itself.  But if it's -- \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  \nMR. HEVESI:  -- longer term -- just one last thing --\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMR. HEVESI:  If it's longer term, that turns from a \nkid feeling abandoned into depressed and long-term consequences.\nMS. WALSH:  So, I mean, I -- I would just say back \nto you that, yeah, I mean, definitely I've represented kids who get a lot \nout of visiting with their parents.  To me, it depends on how messed \nup the parents are.  I mean, sometimes parents just have to do some \nwork.  They have to do some work.  And sometimes they have such \nmental health problems, and we all have talked in this Chamber how \nmany times about the absence of good mental health care that's \navailable and that's accessible to people.  It -- it depends.  Sometimes \nit's a great idea.  But I also have had family court cases where I've \nrepresented a kid from pretty much infancy up to 18.  That whole \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n199time.  So under this bill, would you contemplate that that child, that \nchild I'm giving you the hypothetical of, would start getting supervised \nvisits in infancy and those visits would continue until 18?  \nMR. HEVESI:  It's not up to me, it's up to a court.  \nIt's judicial discretion.  If the court decides -- so I -- and by the way, I \ncompletely appreciate your point about mental health.  If the judge \ndecides that for whatever reason the parent is not in a position to be \ninteracting with that kid, that it could have a negative impact on the \nchild, then the judge has every right to say no.  But quite the reverse, \nmaybe the parent will do better if they're in contact with the kid.  \nMaybe the parent is -- \nMS. WALSH:  Sometimes. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.  Maybe the parent is \nexperiencing some underlying conditions that are exacerbated by, Oh \nmy God, I don't have my kid.  My family's not here.\nMS. WALSH:  That's true.  I've seen that, too.  Yeah.\nMR. HEVESI:  So overall, I'm gonna argue that it is \nin the fundamental interest of every New Yorker for these families to \nbe kept together as long as a judge decides that it's safe for the kid. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  And of course I've got plenty \nof clients who hit around 15, 16 who then will go in and do a Lincoln \nhearing with the judge and say, I don't want to see  -- I -- I've had -- it's \nsad -- 10-, 11-year-old clients who say, You know what  -- who are \nparentified, kind of, and they say, You know , my mom's got a lot of \nwork to do. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n200MR. HEVESI:  Yes.\nMS. WALSH:  And --\nMR. HEVESI:  By the way, can I give you another \nthought that just occurred to me?  And I apologize, I don't mean to \ntake you off topic. \nMS. WALSH:  That's okay.  I -- I'm gonna ask you all \nthe questions --\nMR. HEVESI:  I know you are.\nMS. WALSH:  -- that I have, but we've got time. \nMR. HEVESI:  I know you are.  No -- no, my thought \nis you're also preventing family separation, which is costly to the \nState.  Okay?  So if there's gonna be -- if the parent has no connection \nto the child, I would argue it's much more likely that there will be \neventually a full break in the legal -- in the legal realm, and that costs \nmoney; court time, foster care, all of it.  So this 25 million is really a \ngood way to make sure it's preventative.  Make sure that these \nproblems aren't happening, they're not metastasizing and getting \nworse. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  So, no, I -- I think that, like, if \nthe child is placed in foster care then visits are being facilitated \nthrough foster care Child Protective Services, DSS.  If there's an \nArticle 10 case and the case is pending, then you've got -- the CPS \nworkers are facilitating where -- where appropriate, visitation with \nparents. \nMR. HEVESI:  If -- if they can. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n201MS. WALSH:  It just depends.  The people that fall \nwithin the cracks, so-to-speak, are the people who are in on a simple \n-- they're not always simple -- but custody matter, and there's -- and \nthere's -- it's a complicated Article 6 case, right?  \nMR. HEVESI:  You're right.\nMS. WALSH:  So you've got mental health issues, \nyou've got domestic violence issues.  And, you know, we're not \ntalking about visits just during the pendency of the case.  If there's a \nfinal court order going forward, that could -- that could mandate \ncontinued visits. \nMR. HEVESI:  But not paid for.  We -- we stopped \nafter a certain point.  \nMS. WALSH:  Oh, good.  At a certain point.  Could \nyou point that out?  Thank you. \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely.  Let me -- let me pull that \ntogether. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. HEVESI:  The way it was --\n(Pause)\nNo, I don't have it.  Sorry.  Ask me the question \nagain.  I apologize, Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  I think you -- you just were -- you \nwe're just volunteering a piece of information. \nMR. HEVESI:  Then forget it.\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n202MR. HEVESI:  It wasn't worth it. \nMS. WALSH:  Yup.  Yup.  Okay.  That's all right.  \nWe'll move on. \nMR. HEVESI:  My apologies. \nMS. WALSH:  No, no.  That's okay.  I'm a stream of \nconsciousness person, too.  So I get it.  Okay.  \nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you. \nMS. WALSH:  So getting back to funding for a \nsecond.  You talked about the 25 million at the State level --\nMR. HEVESI:  Yup.\nMS. WALSH:  -- right, and you were talking about \nwhat a great investment that was.  And then you started talking about \ncounties.  What -- what would be the county share in developing this \nprogram?  \nMR. HEVESI:  All the counties have to do is add \nbasic information to their annual child welfare plans that give the \nfollowing pieces of information. \nMS. WALSH:  So they're just data collecting?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah, pretty much.  So, one, you \nhave to -- local needs, program plans, usage data, projected cost.  And \nthen there are two other pieces that will be in that plan; emphasis on \naffordability, and cultural and language accessibility.  So as long as \nthe counties -- all they have to do is put that information in their \nannual plans that they're doing anyway, then they can receive these \nfunds. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n203MS. WALSH:  So they're -- this is -- the counties are \ngonna be advancing the funds and then they're gonna get reimbursed \nby the State?  \nMR. HEVESI:  No, no, no, no.  We're gonna work \nthat out in next year's budget.  No, I'm not asking the counties to lay \nout any money and I'm not asking for any county money.  I wouldn't \nput up a bill that does that. \nMS. WALSH:  So this is 100 percent gonna be \nfunded through the State. \nMR. HEVESI:  That is absolutely true.  That's what \nI'm --  \nMS. WALSH:  So a budget item in next year's budget \n--\nMR. HEVESI:  Correct.\nMS. WALSH:  -- if this bill passes and gets signed by \nthe Governor. \nMR. HEVESI:  That's right.  I would not put forward \na bill that adds extra burdens to our counties. \nMS. WALSH:  No, I -- I'm very appreciative of that.   \nWhat -- what -- what -- in a -- in a nutshell, what -- \nand I see I'm running -- I -- just so that we all know, I'm running out \nthe clock on my first 15.  I'm -- I'm gonna need a second to be able to \nfinish up with you. \nMR. HEVESI:  Sure. \nMS. WALSH:  So in the bill it talks about culturally- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n204sensitive services.  That -- what does -- what does that mean?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Different communities, people speak \ndifferent languages.\nMS. WALSH:  So it's language (indiscernible/ \ncross-talk) --\nMR. HEVESI:  It's language.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.  So -- so the counties will have \nto say, We have these , you know, population s, we have these language \nneeds.  That -- that's pretty much it. \nMS. WALSH:  So the supervisor who's gonna be \nsupervising a visit will be speaking the same language as the people \nthat they're -- that they're supervising. \nMR. HEVESI:  That's crucially important, \nparticularly in certain neighborhoods in our larger cities. \nMS. WALSH:  Yep.  Are they even available?  Are \nthose --  \nMR. HEVESI:  Obviously, you used the word right in \nthe beginning of your description.  There's a dearth.  But that dearth \napplies to everything, so I don't think so.  We -- we are so behind the \neight ball on this one that we're causing other multiple problems. \nMS. WALSH:  Why not just do a pilot program?  \nMR. HEVESI:  This is.  \nMS. WALSH:  Why not -- no, this is saying that \nwithin six months -- unless I'm wrong, please -- but this is saying that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n205within 180 days we're gonna have a program to make sure that there's \none of these in every county that doesn't have them.  That's not a pilot \nprogram, that is a huge, huge lift, in my humble opinion.  You know?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Fair enough.  Okay.  \nMS. WALSH:  Okay?  All right.  Okay.  \nIs there anything -- there's -- it didn't seem like there \nwas anything limiting in here.  So like in cases where there's family \nviolence --  \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah. \nMS. WALSH:  -- this would facilitate supervised \nvisits if the court orders it with both the -- the --\nMR. HEVESI:  Custodial and non-custodial parent?\nMS. WALSH:  Or the -- the parent that has \nperpetrated the domestic violence and the survivor of the domestic \nviolence. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yes, the alleged abuser.  Absolutely. \nMS. WALSH:  Both.\nMR. HEVESI:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. WALSH:  If it's ordered. \nMR. HEVESI:  Only if the judge orders it.  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Is there -- there's nothing in here as \nfar as frequency of visits?  \nMR. HEVESI:  This is all judicial discretion.  We're \nnot touching that area. \nMS. WALSH:  You mentioned earlier that out of the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n206counties that do have this program they have long waiting lists. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.  New York City has a wait list.  \nSo if you're ordered in New York City for supervised -- professional \nsupervised visitation you are immediately gonna be on one of three \nwait lists that last anywhere between six months and a year.  Some \nlonger than that.  We are nowhere near dealing with the capacity. \nMS. WALSH:  Why not try to put resources towards \nsolving those -- those existing programs and their difficulties rather \nthan trying to create --\nMR. HEVESI:  We are.\nMS. WALSH:  -- so many new ones?  \nMR. HEVESI:  We are.  The money that we are \nputting forward here, the 25 million that will be subject in the next \nbudget, can be used to expand existing programs or where there's a \ngap, say -- you know, we -- we always talk about child care deserts.  \nSo let's say it's a supervised visitation desert, they can put a new \nprogram there.  But they are going to be trying to base their efforts on \nexisting programs. \nMS. WALSH:  And -- and that's part of my issue.  So, \nI mean, how many times here in this Chamber have we talked about \nhow you can't find any day cares for your kids?  They don't have slots.  \nYou can't find direct care workers.  You can't find court interpreters.  \nWe were talking about that a couple of days ago.  You can't find \nanybody.  How are you possibly gonna staff something like this?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Well, we're gonna put the money \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n207there and hope that these programs can expand.  And I believe once \nthe money is there that people will start, you know, hopefully growing \nthese businesses.  That's the hope.  If -- if it doesn't happen, then we're \nstill in the circumstance where we're using unsupervised visitation \nwhere -- where it can be a little dangerous, as you know. \nMS. WALSH:  So when it says at the end \"this act \nshall take effect on the 180th day after it shall have become a law\", so \nhow is that realistic with what needs to happen here?  \nMR. HEVESI:  That a terrific question.  So -- so the \nanswer is this:  I'm hoping this bill gets signed, okay?  There is a \nchance that the Governor vetoes it.  Once we pass the Senate there's a \nchance that the Governor vetoes this bill and then we'll start back in \nthe budget.  But I wanted to have this debate publicly, tactically, \nbecause if you do it in next year's budget it gets lost.  Just in Children \nand Family Services alone there's about 20, 25 issues that demand our \nattention; increase child care money.  You know the rest of the story.  \nSo if I tried to insert this into next year's budget, I would be competing \nwith not only my own priorities, but every other member's priorities, \nand this wouldn't get the due diligence that it requires.  So bringing it \nup today, now all of my colleagues know that they have probably \n(indiscernible) counties without supervised visitation, and when I \ncome to them in March and say we need your signature to help us get \nmore money for them, hopefully they'll be more receptive. \nMS. WALSH:  Well, I'm glad I could be a part of \nyour master plan strategy here. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n208MR. HEVESI:  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't call it that, \nbut I do appreciate it, Ms. Walsh.  Thank you. \nMS. WALSH:  Let me just review my notes, but I \nthink you've pretty much answered...  All right.  You talked about fee \nwaivers for people who can't afford to pay. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Would there be -- do you envision \nthat anybody is gonna be able to pay for these services on their -- on \ntheir own?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely.  If -- if people have the \nmeans, they should absolutely pay for these services.  It's a business.  \nWhat we're trying to do in the State is not only make sure that we have \nthe infrastructure, but also provide additional resources to families \nwho have low income and are finding themselves in a circumstance \nwhere they've been separated. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And there's no need that \npeople -- they don't have to plead like a domestic violence case or \nanything like that in order to get the attention.  They just have to -- it \nhas to be something that the court will order. \nMR. HEVESI:  Correct. \nMS. WALSH:  And the court that could order it \nwould be family court. \nMR. HEVESI:  Supreme as well.  Family and \nSupreme.  \nMS. WALSH:  Supreme as well, and a matrimonial \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n209action. \nMR. HEVESI:  I believe. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Let's see.  Okay.  I think that I \nhave -- you have done a very good job answering all the questions that \nI've got.  Thank you so much.  \nMR. HEVESI:  So you're gonna vote yes?  \nMS. WALSH:  Oh, I'm not gonna -- I'm gonna go on \nthe bill now and explain --\nMR. HEVESI:  I just gave it a shot.\nMS. WALSH:  -- why this is a terrible idea.\nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you, Ms. Walsh.  I appreciate \nit.\nMS. WALSH:  With great respect.\nOn the bill, please. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  So here's the thing.  We know that \nthere is a problem.  We know that there's a problem.  You know, we -- \nwe agree on that.  The thing is how do we -- how do we get there.  \nYou know, we just collectively passed a $254 billion budget and there \nwas no money put in for this.  And we all know how much the \nGovernor loves the idea of us passing things and then -- that have no \nmoney that's been -- that's allocated for it.  So, I mean, I would -- I \ndon't -- I can't predict what the Governor would do.  I don't even know \nif the Senate will pass it.  But yeah, we're getting the ball rolling, we're \nhaving the discussion.  That's a good thing.  But here's why I don't \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n210think that the bill is ready for this to advance.  I think it is -- I think it \nis -- I -- I don't want to be at all disrespectful because I think that, you \nknow, the heart is in the right place and there is a need.  But this is -- \nthis is a -- an incredible lift.  When a problem has been kicked down \nthe road so long and it's gotten to be such a big problem, putting an \n180-day effective date and saying that you want it in every county in \nthe State and saying that you want the State to pay for all of it and, \nyou know, it's just -- it's just a lot.  And I'm telling you, the number of \ncases, it -- it would be most of the cases in my family court caseload \nwould want and ask for -- ask a judge for supervised visits.  I'm just \nsaying that we don't have the people and we're not gonna get the \npeople.  I -- I didn't even get to talking with the sponsor about what \nyou're even gonna pay these people to do supervision.  And some \nsupervision really is gonna have to be by trained mental health \nprofessionals.  You know, when the churches used to do supervised \nvisits, they were very, like, well-meaning retirees that had a real heart \nand wanted to be able to do this kind of work.  And that -- and that \nworks for some cases.  I have -- I have had cases where -- I had -- one \n-- one is just coming to my mind that I'll just share with you.  I \nrepresented a little girl from the age of, I think she was probably six \nwhen I started representing her, and her family hasn't been back in \ncourt recently.  I will continue to take her case until she ages out of \nthe family court system because I care for her.  But she has a mom \nwho has really profound issues with low IQ and very serious mental \nhealth issues, who absolutely loves her daughter, who cannot observe  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n211boundaries.  Who can't resist the urge to call her, which violates \nOrders of Protection which then lands her back in jail.  Then she gets \nout of jail, she does it again.  She gets involved in terrible \nrelationships with sex offenders.  She -- she's just not bad enough to \nterminate her parental rights, and we don't want to because she loves \nher daughter.  But she's -- she cannot be even in a supervised setting \nfor very long with her daughter before she's saying or doing something \nthat is just wholly inappropriate.  So she needs a trained supervisor \nwho has the courage to stand up -- and she happens to be a big lady, \ntoo -- and say, You know what?  You're being inappropriate.  We need \nto terminate this visit .  And all of that -- we talk about trauma to the \nchild to be separated from the parent?  Sometimes being exposed to a \nparent who is that deficient, that's traumatizing, too.  So we need -- if \nwe're gonna put a program into place, I think we need to have very \nhighly-trained people available who, of course, are gonna have to be \nculturally competent, who are gonna need to speak whatever language \nthe people are -- the child and the parents are speaking.  \nI mean, do you have a sense, am I painting a picture \nfor you of just how hard this is?  And I -- I have the greatest respect \nfor the sponsor and his desire to do the right thing, and I also want to \ndo the right thing.  This bill is not ready.  It is not ready.  To -- the \nidea -- and I always rail against this, and I'm gonna rail against it \nagain.  We -- we put out a -- a feeling, a sense of what we want to \naccomplish, and then what do we do?  We pick the Office for the \nPrevention of Domestic Violence and the Office of Victim Services  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n212and we go,  Here, you got 180 days.  Good luck .  You know?  See what \nyou can come up with , and we'll see next April what we can come up \nwith for -- for money.  Or April or May or June or whenever the \nbudget gets passed next year, right?  \nSo this is just -- it's a -- it's a good-intentioned [sic], \nbut it doesn't have the structure.  It does not have the funding.  It does \nnot have the personnel.  And what I'm saying to all of you who are \nhere and those of you who may be listening, is it's very difficult when \nyou have a bill that is titled and starts out by saying \"supervised \nvisitation to support safe, structured parenting time.\"  All right, who \ndoesn't agree with that, right?  We agree with that.  \nI'm asking you to have the courage to vote no to this \nbill not because we don't care about it, because this bill is not ready.  \nAnd I would like, through some no votes, to establish to the Governor \nconcerns that we cannot just create a policy, delegate it to these -- to \nthese well-meaning, you know, agencies, not fund it for a good long \nwhile, and not have any idea of the personnel that are gonna be able to \nstaff it.  So I'm asking you all to have a little bit of courage and -- and \nvote no, with respect to the sponsor, with great respect and concern \nfor this issue.  We're just -- this is -- this bill is not ready yet.  So \nunfortunately, I will have to vote in the negative and I -- I do \nencourage my colleagues to do the same.\nThank you very much, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Chang. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n213MR. CHANG:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Would \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely, sir.  How are you?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. CHANG:  Well, thank you for this bill.  It's very \nbold.  And -- in my community in Sunset Park and Borough Park it's a \nhuge, huge issues about these parental supervision itself, especially the \nJewish community as well.  And -- and I have no faith OPWDD were \nable to be faithfully to execute this -- this bold initiative you have.  \nBecause how would you able professional services?  How do -- are \nthere any -- how do we classify them?  What's professional or not?  \nAre they certification or not, sir?  \nMR. HEVESI:  So -- so first, thank you for -- for the \nquestion.  The -- the answer is we are relying on the Office of Victim \nServices, that's the -- the group we picked, and they are hopefully -- \nand this is our hope, I didn't want to put this in the legislation -- there \nwas a Federal book of guidelines done on what you need specifically \nfor supervised visitation, and I mean I'm talking down to if you have \nto leave a kid in one door and out -- come in the front door, the abuser \ncomes out the other door.  So I'm gonna be hoping that the Office of \nVictim Services follows those Federal guidelines.  I did not want to \nput them in the bill to tie their hands, but I believe that they are the \nappropriate entity to handle this. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n214MR. CHANG:  And do you expect any, like, \ncertification or process for these professional certification itself?  \nMR. HEVESI:  I'm -- I'm not expecting certification.  \nI don't -- I don't think these are certified positions.  But I'm expecting a \nlevel of professionalism that I know that we don't have now.  And by \ninfusing State money into this system and by requiring them to do a \nnumber of things, we're hoping to professionalize what is clearly -- \nand I'll use my colleague's term -- a dearth of appropriate services for \nour constituents. \nMR. CHANG:  Because as it is right now, in -- in \nNew York City there's a shortage of the professional staffing itself, \nand your bold enough to be all throughout the State, and Upstate here \nis even less of the services --  \nMR. HEVESI:  Yes, sir.\nMR. CHANG:  -- are trained.  So perhaps it should \nbe structured maybe some professionalism on a supervised level so \nthey can -- \nMR. HEVESI:  So, let me answer you this way \nbecause I -- I think you're on to something.  So, there's several types of \nvisitation.  So there's unsupervised -- we're not talking about that, \nthat's family.  There's -- there's regular supervised visitation, which I \nthink is just evaluative.  But then I think you're right, there's \ntherapeutic supervised visitation where the judge says, No, we got to \nhave a professional  in the room .  So it will be a combination of those \ntwo. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n215MR. CHANG:  Okay.  And how would that be \ncompeting against foster care?  Because that could be a fine line of \nfoster care, a supervised visit; wouldn't that?  \nMR. HEVESI:  You mean you're taking people from \nthe foster care industry --  \nMR. CHANG:  That's correct. \nMR. HEVESI:  -- to this?  To be honest with you, I \nhaven't though about that, although that's a huge problem in the foster \ncare industry.  Because we, under the former Governor, stopped \npaying the people in the foster care industry.  Their turnover rates are \nridiculously high.  But I don't think that propping up supervised \nvisitation and making it more professional is gonna significantly add \nto the -- to the turnover rate.  Just because COFCCA, the group that \nsupports all of those agencies, is, I believe, for this.  Or I can \nguarantee they did not come out against it. \nMR. CHANG:  Yes.  And especially in domestic \nviolence environment.  And generally, parents and kids are outside \nfrom -- from the -- from the neighborhood.  Generally you don't \ncongregate in the same neighborhood, they always go to the different \nneighborhood.  So that's hard to do.  And you want to be culturally \nsensitive, especially in a Jewish neighborhood because you need \nkosher food, you need all those support system.  If -- if there's a \ndomestic violence issue they have to be relocate some other area that \nmay not be culturally sensitive. \nMR. HEVESI:  Well, it's a -- it's a really good point, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n216and particularly -- look, you and I are from New York City with the \nmost ethnically and culturally-diverse city in the history of the world.  \nAnd that's why we are gonna ask the City to send out in their annual -- \nthat they do this every year -- Child Welfare Plan and tell us exactly \nwhat they need and then the State will hopefully be able to provide it. \nMR. CHANG:  Okay.  And 25 million, to be honest, \nthat's not enough money. \nMR. HEVESI:  It's the best money we've ever spent.  \nAnd -- and I'm telling you, I would spend more than that to keep these \nfamilies together.  To -- to take away the adverse childhood \nexperiences and the trauma of family separation that government is \ndoing, we are part and parcel to -- let me take that back.  We are \nexacerbating family separation with our -- with our incompetence and \nthis is our -- a way to fix it. \nMR. CHANG:  Well, my colleagues made a very \ngood point that this is a very bold program, and I applaud you to -- to \nput this, because this is really necessary in this current age right now.\nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you, sir.\nMR. CHANG:  But I would think our current \nstructure administratively is able to handle this -- this new program \nitself unless you could implement like a project itself that can grow \nout. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah, I -- I understand that.  So look, \nthis is about getting the -- the ball rolling.  The next step -- so first of \nall, if the Governor signs it I'm sure there'll be an amendment process \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n217which you could address some of these things.  Or worst case, she \nvetoes it and I'm here back asking you guys to -- to vote for this next \nyear.  But we've got a jump start for all of my colleagues \nunderstanding the program. \nMR. CHANG:  Okay.  And the only thing more \npressing issue for me is how to keep culturally-sensitive and to keep \nthe family and the environment that the kids normally go to school \nlocally, familiarizing with their -- with their friends.  And again, it's \ntraumatically just to strip away from their parents, but also stripped \naway from the neighborhood, from the kids that they have friends and \nneighbors that they associate. \nMR. HEVESI:  I -- I agree.  So -- so kids under the \ncircumstances are having extreme difficulty.  This is traumatic.  This \ncould be life-changing.  So what we're doing is trying to make sure \nthat the parents have access to their kids, and that's good for New \nYork families, that's good for the taxpayers in the long run. \nMR. CHANG:  Thank you.\nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you, sir.\nMR. CHANG:  On the bill.  Thank you.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. CHANG:  I applaud the sponsor for this bill.  It's \na very bold move and we really need that.  But I have no confidence \nour current administrative OPWDD to administrative this bill \nadequately.  But it's a start.  And I wish we have a project, a pilot \nprogram so we expend what we have and not to -- not to duplicate \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n218some of the services itself. \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nMr. Manktelow. \nMR.

How are you doing?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Mr. Hevesi. \nWho's doing this right now?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Non-profit providers mostly. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So do you know what the cost \nis right now across the State for doing this?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.  So it -- well, it's -- $75 is the -- \nthe cheapest we could find is $75 per one-hour session.  And by the \nway, that's the cheapest.  There are those that -- that run up higher \nthan that. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  And -- and who's funding \nthat?  Who's paying for that?  \nMR. HEVESI:  So right now it's the -- it's -- it's the \nparents.  It's the parents who are financially able to do it are able -- are \n-- are trying to -- to do it and prop up these businesses.  But the \nbusiness is not enough.  You can see counties don't have these.  And \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n219so we are trying to solve two problems at once with the same thing.  \nBy investing money here, you're helping the court system, you're \nhelping these families, and you're also helping these kids.  So it seems \nto make sense. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So -- so what is the price tag \nright now the way it is today?  Do you know?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Oh, for the State?  Right now it's \nzero. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  No, I meant, like, what -- \nwhat are parents paying for across the State?  What does that -- what \ndoes that dollar number look like?  \nMR. HEVESI:  So, it's $75 per -- per one hour. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  No, I got that part.\nMR. HEVESI:  Okay.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  I'm at what's the total cost \nright now parents are paying across the State?  What's --  \nMR. HEVESI:  I have no idea.  And the reason is \nbecause it depends on the services that are available, it depends -- \nsome -- some of these non-profits don't offer all of the services, some \nhave particularly high, and then you have the counties that have \nnothing.  So there's no way for me to estimate that, sir. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Well, the reason I asked was I \nwas wondering where you came up with the $25 million. \nMR. HEVESI:  I am so smart that I got it from the \nOffice of Court Administration.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n220MR. MANKTELOW:  I may believe that. \nMR. HEVESI:  You should.  You should. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So -- so you think $25 million \nwill cover this to start with?  \nMR. HEVESI:  That -- that's my understanding as -- \nas of this point.  But again, we have process to go through here.  It's \ngot to get through Senate Finance, the Governor's gonna have to \nweigh in.  She might kick it out to the budget.  And then my \nexperience with our friends at the Division of Budget, they are always \na lot bigger with the cost estimate than what it actually is.  So we'll -- \nwe'll work it there, but I think 25 million is a good ballpark for us to \nget our head around. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Well, I have a lot of faith in \nyou, so it's possible.  \nMR. HEVESI:  I appreciate it. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  But -- so let's say it goes \nthrough the way it is --\nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Do you see local governments \nor counties getting involved in this?  \nMR. HEVESI:  No.  Only to the extent that they have \nto, in their Child Welfare Plans that they do annually, add six pieces of \ninformation requesting what their needs are.  That's it.  No county \nmoney.  I would not put a bill on the floor -- I mean, I've been here for \nclose to 20 years and I've seen the former Governor, in particular, beat \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n221the hell out of these counties for no reason.  I will not be part of that. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  We -- we've talked \nabout day care providers back home taking care of our children -- \nMR. HEVESI:  Yes, sir.\nMR. MANKTELOW: -- and one of the things that \nNew York State has pushed was we want to get our day cares [sic] \nproviders moving to grow to get people back to work.  Well, we \naccomplished that, but now that the State sees just how much that cost \nis gonna be, they're pulling the reins back on that. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah, but we're not done yet. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Okay.  I got you.  I -- I -- as I \nsaid, I have a lot of faith in you, so --\nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you.  I appreciate it.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  So I'm hoping so.\nMR. HEVESI:  I hope to live up to it. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  My concern is if we put this \n25 million in there, I just don't want future leadership, future \nadministrations to --to pull that money back.  Because we -- we seem \nto do this in New York a lot.  We get the ball rolling, things are \nmoving forward.  We get our county governments geared up to -- to \ndo stuff such as the day care providing services or, you know, funding \nit.  And then all of a sudden, Well, we're spending way too much \nmoney.  We got to pull it back.  And who are we hurting?  The young \nchildren, the families.  Families of low-income.\nMR. HEVESI:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n222MR. MANKTELOW:  And we're getting them back \nto work when we're having a -- an issue in New York State of not \nbeing able to fill all the jobs that are out there.  So that's just my \nconcern is if this moves forward -- \nMR. HEVESI:  That's a legit point.  I appreciate that. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Will -- will we be able to fund \nit, how -- how we will be able to fund it.  And --  \nMR. HEVESI:  So -- so my answer would be -- so \nfirst of all, absolutely a legitimate point.  We're gonna do our best to \nnot only get this money appropriated, but every year keep coming \nback and making sure like we do in other years, even though there are \ntons of other areas of need throughout the State that you and I discuss \nall the time, to not let this be raided because we understand the \nsignificant tentacles that this has.  When this is screwed up like it is \nnow, it's problems all over the place; bad courts, bad for your kids, \nbad for these parents.  It's a mess.  So yeah, we're gonna look to get \nthe money in and keep it and make sure nobody else raids it. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  I -- as -- as the previous \nspeaker said, he liked how bold you are doing this.  I -- I think it's a \ngreat initiative.  I do have concerns about the funding.  I do have \nconcerns about our -- our initial speaker -- our initial person asking, \nyou know, where we gonna get the people, how are we gonna make \nthis all happen.  And in 180 days, I just don't see that happen -- \nhappening locally.  I just don't think the people are there or the \nexpertise is there.  And I know we could put the money there, but it's \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n223still takes time to fill those positions and get the game plan on there.  \nSo -- \nMR. HEVESI:  I appreciate that and I understand that \nconcern.  I'm -- I'm here to tell you I'm gonna do my best to make sure \nthat this doesn't become a problem, but I understand the concern. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  Mr. Hevesi, thank \nyou for answering my few questions --\nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you, sir.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  -- and I wish you the best on \nthis because I do hope it goes through.  So thank you.  \nMR. HEVESI:  I hope it goes through.  If not, we'll \nbe back here next year talking about it, my friend.  So thank you. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  I'm looking \nforward.\nMR. HEVESI:  I appreciate it.  Thank you.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Again, like my colleagues said \nbefore me, I think we all feel that this in good -- we have good \nintentions to make this happen for these families, for these young \nchildren.  The funding is the question; the funding long-term from the \nState side is a question.  So, but I have hope.\nSo thank you for allowing me to ask a few questions \nthis evening.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n224Mrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  Would the sponsor yield for a couple of questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Be my pleasure. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  I actually was very \nintrigued by the first comments made by our colleague on the other \nside of the aisle, is that the access to resources to provide these \nservices has dried up.  And then when I, you know, think about -- I -- I \nlistened to -- and I -- I know that this is an area that she's worked in \nfor years, and so I -- I trust her comments on it.  How -- how did we \nget here to a place where we have so many families that are \ndysfunctional to the extent that they need the courts or the system to \nhelp take care of their children and we need to find a way to pay for \nit?  I mean, I -- I don't -- you know, I feel like I'm old enough to know \nthat there was a time when that didn't happen and our society wasn't \nlike this.  So I don't know if it's something that you have the ability to \nhave thought through already or even have the desire to look into, but \nhow did we get here?  \nMR. HEVESI:  That's a great question.  I wish -- I \nwish I had an answer that was sufficient.  And I don't want to make \none up.  The answer is I don't know.  But I understand the \ncircumstance that we're in now, and I'm listening to the professionals \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n225who are telling us this is the solution to -- to address this chronic \nproblem that, you're right, has metastasized.  And Ms. Walsh is right, \nthere's this dearth of services.  So I'm not exactly sure how we got to \nthis point.  It's got to be a -- a multiple reenforcing issues that are \ncombining.  But we are here now and I believe that this is the \nappropriate solution. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Well, thank you.\nOn the bill, Madam Speaker. \nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  I -- I want to join my \ncolleagues in complimenting the sponsor of this legislation because if \nwe never figure out how we got here, it's gonna be kind of hard to fix \nit, in a way.  Because it's always gonna cost more and more and more \nif we don't figure out how to go back and fix the trauma-infused lives \nthat people have lived in our society.  And so I hope that at some point \nwe can get to that.  But in the meantime, you really have to \ncompliment the sponsor of this legislation for figuring out that we -- \nwe have -- we have to do this.  We have to find a way to make both \nparents and children comfortable enough to get to a place where they \ncan start getting the kind of quality service that they need that could \nperhaps move us away from these dysfunctional families to a life \nwhen we are back into a society where families function properly.  \nAnd even if some of them don't, we want the vast majority of them to.  \nAnd in order to do that we have to provide them services.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n226So I don't know.  I remember days when Catholic \nCharities would always be available to provide these services.  I \nremember when churches would always have their doors open to \nprovide these types of services.  I remember when people went into \nfoster care and weren't abused by their foster parents.  I mean, life is \nso -- changed so much in our society, and I think sometimes our \nfrivolous debates around resources adds to that negatively as opposed \nto positively.  \nSo I don't know how we're gonna make this 25 \nmillion happen to get this done in the next budget, but I know it needs \nto happen.  And I congratulate the sponsor of this legislation and I \nlook forward to voting for -- in the affirmative on it. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Burroughs. \nMR. BURROUGHS:  Yes.  Just will the sponsor \nyield for a few questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. HEVESI:  Absolutely. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. BURROUGHS:  Yes.  First comment is that I \nwould like to agree with Madam Speaker -- Majority Leader, and we \ndo have to find -- figure out a place how to fix this.  Sad -- sadly, I \ndon't think we should be legislating the way people raise children, or \nat least should coparent children.  But here we are, and we have to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n227find ways to fix it.  \nBut supervised visitation in some respects sounds like \nit should be something that's positive.  But a lot of times it penalizes \none parent based on the information given to the authorities from \nanother parent.  And so now we have to find a way to pay for \nsomething that may not be true.  I've seen plenty of dads and moms \nhave to go through the process or have to go through a court system in \norder to just spend time with their children, and I don't think it's right.  \nI don't think it's fair.  So does the Legislature try and figure out a way \nto effectively get information?  Does it make -- does it verify it's \naccurate?  Because we're gonna put money towards something and we \ndon't know if it's true. \nMR. HEVESI:  Yeah.  I totally appreciate the \nquestion, thank you.  So the answer is that these programs are gonna \nbe required to be part of the (indiscernible) -- first of all, you're \nallowing the children and family to be together, which I think we both \nagree is a positive step.  But it also -- you're able to send information \nto the court, so the court will now understand exactly what's going on.  \nBut to your initial point, which I completely agree with, this is up to \nthe judges.  And if somebody comes in with false information and \nthey fool the judge, there's nothing that we, in the Legislature, can do \nabout that.  We rely on the judges to make these determinations.  So \nwhat we're trying to do is when the judges make whatever \ndeterminations based off of whatever factor, provide the infrastructure \nif supervised visitation is needed.  By the way, it's mostly needed in \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n228abuse cases or family violence cases. \nMR. BURROUGHS:  Thank you.  I can appreciate \nyou saying you're -- you know, you don't -- you're not sure if we can \nenforce something that was told that we find out to be something that \nwasn't true.  So if -- if the custodial parent says something that didn't \nhappen, and now the noncustodial parent has to suffer the \nconsequences of that, and on top of that we're funding that. \nMR. HEVESI:  Well, that's the existing system \nalready, right?  That happens now.  So the fact that we're funding it, \nwe're trying to make it more professional.  And if there's bad \ninteractions between the family, you know, the potential abuser and \nthe child or the other -- another member of the family, that's being \nreported back to the court.  What we're doing is taking -- and you're -- \nyou're not wrong about the circumstance, right?  I -- I appreciate that.  \nWhat we're trying to do is professionalize the operation that has to \nhandle these things. \nMR. BURROUGHS:  So was there a thought to put a \nprovision -- add a provision to, I'd say, penalize?  Had there been a \nstory that was told that we found ought to be inaccurate, is there a \nprovision that's set forth in this -- this bill to penalize a person for \ntelling a non-truth?  \nMR. HEVESI:  So -- so the answer is, in this -- so I'm \na legislator doing my best to create a -- fund a program.  That kind of \nanalysis has to be done by the Judicial Branch.  That's -- that's not up \nto me.  And if a parent is lying to the judge, that's up for a judge to do \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n229the reprimanding.  But that's -- that's not part of this bill.  We're just \ntrying to create the infrastructure if the judge determines that it's \nunsafe for a child to be with a parent, that they can actually have \nparenting time with their kid in a safe, supervised arena. \nMR. BURROUGHS:  All right.  Thank you. \nMR. HEVESI:  Thank you, sir. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect on the 180th \nday. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)  \nMr. Lavine to explain his vote. \nMR. LAVINE:  We often rise to recognize the \ncontributions of the sponsors of these bills, and while we're always \nexercising candor when we do that, I want to make a special \nrecognition for the sponsor of this bill.  The substance of this bill is \nthe result of testimony taken during a joint hearing of the Children and \nFamilies Committee and the Judiciary Committee in December of \n2024.  The hearing was compelling.  It was gut-wrenching.  And the \nsponsor is now presenting us with a plan to formulate a Statewide \nplan.  This is pretty straightforward.  And it is the best thing we can do \nright now to try to make sure that kids are protected. \nNow, is it gonna cost money?  Everything costs \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n230money.  It will cost money.  But if we don't advance this plan, \nMahatma Gandhi would be very angry at us, because it was Mahatma \nGandhi himself who said, If you don't ask , you don't get.  So we are \nasking.  And if we can do this, we will save children's lives, and that's \na darn good thing for us to do.\nSo I vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Lavine in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Norber to explain his vote. \nMR. NORBER :  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I want \nto thank the sponsor of this bill.  It's a very important bill. \nI believe that many of the problems that we have here \nin our State stem from the millions of families who suffer from \ndysfunctionality and from instability.  Our -- our social problems that \nwe have and we witness here every day and that we deal with every \nday here in this Chamber, originate from the families who are \nsuffering.  So I believe that any initiative that we can come up with \nhere in -- in our Chamber would be -- which helps these families, no \nmatter what the costs are, should be on top of our agenda every day.  \nSo we owe it to these kids.\nSo thank you very much. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Norris in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Forrest to explain her vote. \nMS. FORREST:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n231allowing me to stand and explain my vote.  I am standing here to say \nthat when I became a mom I did not get a set of instructions on how to \nbe a parent.  And I'm sure everyone in this -- in this Chamber who \ndecided to become a parent didn't get an instruction either.  And so \nsometimes it's literally somebody else stepping into my house, \nstepping into my life and standing in my shoes that allows you to give \nthe -- allow you to get -- receive feedback on how you can make your \nfamily just a tad better, to support you in that sense.  And so while I \nwould rather it not happen during a court proceeding, but once it gets \nthere this is the time for intervention.  And if there is -- I don't see any \nreason to count the numbers or count the amount of money it takes to \nheal a family.  When -- when that child comes out in the end, they'll \nbe a better person for the society.  \nSo I'm wholly, wholly going to vote in the affirmative \nfor this and I thank the sponsor for their [sic] hard work.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Forrest in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Maher to explain his vote. \nMR. MAHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I did \nwant to also mention the hearing that was set, the joint hearing.  There \nwere some unbelievable stories told.  There was a lot of work to be \ndone.  This is certainly an imperfect situation; we do not know all the \nanswers.  We do not have all the numbers.  But it is important that we \nreally figure out to the closest degree possible how much this will \ncost.  And I say that because there was a conversation about what \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n232caused this problem.  Well, I'll tell you what won't make it better is the \ncurrent situation we're in with our child care subsidy of underfunding \nit to the point where now you have counties throughout the State of \nNew York canceling or putting on waiting lists families that \ndesperately need child care assistance.  That certainly isn't going to \nhelp families create less problems than we have right now. \nSo getting the money right is important.  I do enjoy \nworking with my colleague, the sponsor and the Children and \nFamilies Committee.  This is an area where we need to do something.  \nAnd this is the something that's in front of us, so I will be voting in the \naffirmative.  But we certainly have to keep in mind some of those \nreasons that these families are in the position they're in are because we \nneed to do a little bit better in calculating how we assist and fund \nprograms and don't pull the rug from underneath families that are in \ndesperate need of assistance.\nThank you, Madam Speaker.  I'll be in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Maher in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \n                           Page 17, Rules Report No. 550, the Clerk will read.\nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A01962-B, Rules \nReport No. 550, Anderson, Seawright, Cunningham, Weprin, Cruz, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n233Dinowitz, Epstein, Schiavoni, Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas, Lavine, Romero, \nO'Pharrow, Glick, Griffin, Burdick, Rosenthal, Lasher, Simon, \nBurroughs, Bichotte Hermelyn, Hevesi, Colton, Shimsky, Zaccaro, \nSolages, Jackson, Wieder, Zinerman, Tapia, Taylor, Simone, \nChandler-Waterman, Kassay, Lunsford, Dais, Steck, Sayegh, Rozic, \nStern, Paulin, Torres, Alvarez, Ramos, Gibbs, P. Carroll, Benedetto.  \nAn act to amend the Penal Law, in relation to enacting \"Francesco's \nLaw\"; to amend the Executive Law, in relation to annual reports by \nthe New York State Office of Gun Violence Prevention; and providing \nfor the repeal of certain provisions of the Penal Law relating to safely \nstoring rifles, shotguns, and firearms.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested. \nMr. Anderson.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nThis bill is a very simple bill that would amend safe storage, to make \nit a violation for anyone who fails to safely store a firearm, a shotgun, \nor a rifle and establish a -- a misdemeanor for Failure to Store when \naccessible by a minor or a prohibited person.  Most importantly, \nMadam Speaker, this bill moves us to the gold standard of gun safety.  \nThere are several states, which I'm sure I'll share during today's \ndebate, that if adopted, this level of standard, to ensure that young \npeople do not get access to firearms.  This bill accomplishes that in \nthree ways.  I created a cool little acronym to help you all understand \nhow this bill accomplishes that.  Number one, it creates \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n234accountability.  Number two, it creates data collection.  And number \nthree, it creates deterrence.  And I think that those things are \nimportant.  Just to add some more statistics, between 2016 and 2021, \nsuicides accounted for 36 percent of firearm-related deaths among \nchildren between the ages of 10 and 19.  And what my bill does, and \nit's named after Francesco, who tragically took his own life on \nOctober 21, 2021, with an unsecured firearm.  And so, what my bill \ndoes is not only provide that additional education and resources \nneeded, but it ensures accountability for those who do not properly \nstore their firearms.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Angelino. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWill the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. ANDERSON:  Only for you, Mr. Angelino.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you, sir.  Your -- your tie \nis very straight.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Well, you helped me out earlier.\n(Laughter)\nMR. ANGELINO:  The -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  It was a good birthday gift.  I \nappreciate it.  \nMR. ANGELINO:  The -- first off, any of my line of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n235questioning has nothing to do with the tragedy involved with the \nperson that act is -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly.\nMR. ANGELINO:  -- named for.  And actually, most \nof the questions I'm gonna ask will be questions that are asked of me \nwhen I return back to my -- my big rural district.  So, whatever comes \nout of your mouth, is later gonna come out of mine to explain.  All \nright?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Awesome. \nMR. ANGELINO:  So, first off, we had a safe storage \nbill -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. ANGELINO:  -- that I -- I'm looking at now, has \na lot of it repealed or deleted in red.  What was wrong with that?  \nWhat -- what hole or gap are you trying to fix?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  So, what we did in my \nlegislation here, Francesco's Law, we removed some amendments for \nfelony penalties and we looked at additional supports for information \nso that -- ensure that people can get information.  So, my bill actually \nrequires the New York State Department -- the New York State DCJS \nto be able to collect data, right, which is really important so we can \nknow how many of these suicides, or instances where people get \naccess to firearms who are underaged.  Number two -- so it creates \nthat campaign.  Number two, it ensures that minors -- this is the most \nimportant thing of the bill, Mr. Morinello [sic], the minors won't have \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n236access.  If -- if a minor gets access to a firearm, there are penalties \nin -- in place there as -- as high as a Class A misdemeanor. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  So I can see where the \ngreen portion talks a lot about that study portion of this, but let's talk \nabout the red that you deleted or repealed.  Was there something \nwrong with that that -- that needed to be filled in? \nMR. ANDERSON:  Can you just repeat that?  \nMR. ANGELINO:  The green portion, I'm looking on \nhere -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. ANGELINO:  The green portion is new and \nthat's a lot about the study and some exceptions.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  You're talking about the \nadditions we made.  \nMR. ANGELINO:  Yes -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  And so what we did was we \nadded reporting and data collection.  \nMR. ANGELINO:  Right.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  If you look at the final section of \nthe bill, page 3, we added and gave directives to DCJS to be able to \ncollect data so that we can know.  And this is important -- just -- let \nme just finish.  This is important, because on the Federal level, we're \nnot collecting data presently because that office of Gun Violence \nPrevention is not -- no longer in existence.  And so, what my bill does \nis it adds and gives directives to DCJS to be able to collect data on \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n237that. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  So that's what you added.\n(Conferencing)\nOkay.  And the red section that you deleted, that -- \nthe strikeout or the repeal --\nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. ANGELINO:  -- what was wrong with that?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  No, nothing was wrong with it \nand I think the reason why we made that change is we wanted to make \nan alignment with the gold standard.  There are several states \npresently:  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii and Minnesota \nthat has similar laws and so we just wanted to match that standard. \nMR. ANGELINO:  All right.  So the -- there's -- \nthere's a section in there, I think it's the \"Exceptions.\"  One of them is \n\"unlawful entry\".  What -- what is \"unlawful entry\"?  Does that mean \nburglary, or does that mean actually defeating the locking device or \nthe safe?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  So -- so you're asking me -- so -- \nso unlawful entry could be burglary, right?  That a charge hasn't \nbeen -- I mean, that's a -- that's a criminal charge, right?  So you'd \nhave to give me more specifics on the circumstance of somebody \nentering a property unlawfully.  \nMR. ANGELINO:  The -- the new section, in green, \nLine 40, (reading) If a person obtained the firearm, shotgun, what -- \nwhatever, as a result of unlawful entry.  Does that mean into the safe \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n238or locking device, or just into the home? \nMR. ANDERSON:  Into the home. \nMR. ANGELINO:  So if somebody unlawfully -- and \nwe're talking about maybe somebody who resides there or who's \nprohibited, if they unlawfully enter the safe or gun vault, that's not \ncovered?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  No, it can be both.  \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.\nMR. ANDERSON:  It can be both.  And just -- and \njust keep in mind, I -- I know you used the word \"safe,\" but there are a \nvariety of different ways that you can secure your firearm.  It doesn't \nnecessarily be a safe. \nMR. ANGELINO:  And we will get to that.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  I -- I -- I'm awaiting it. \nMR. ANGELINO:  And the next exception is \n(reading), A person obtains the firearm, rifle or shotgun in a lawful act \nof self-defense, or a defense of another person.  What does that mean \nin your mind?  I -- I don't know what situation that would mean.\n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  I mean, like, there's a \nvariety of different examples of self-defense.  If somebody breaks in \nyour home and you're able to still use, you know, your firearm and not \nbe targeted, or the target or subject matter that we're looking to \nregulate with this piece of legislation. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Or even one of the prohibited \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n239people or a 15-year-old, they can then possess this.  It says (reading), \nA person obtains it in a lawful act of self-defense. \n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  So, I mean, if you -- if \nyou look at the following section, if a minor obtains the firearm for \nself-defense, that's also perfectly okay in -- in this instance of this \npiece of legislation. \nMR. ANGELINO:  That's -- that's in there?  I -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. ANGELINO:  -- I guess I missed that.  Okay -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yup.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Where I live, you are very \naccustomed to handling firearms.  We have a lot of high school \nfirearms teams of various size and style.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Is there anything in here that says \nyou cannot or is -- is illegal to store your firearm loaded?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  Thank you for that question.  So \nthere's nothing particularly in the bill that says that the firearm has to \nbe stored loaded or unloaded. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  So it doesn't -- it's -- that's \nnot covered.  So a loaded firearm stored securely is legal?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n240MR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Thank you.  So, if I live alone, I \ndon't have to store my weapon any place.  I can leave it right on my \nbed stand?  Or, if it's just me and my wife, who's over 18 -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  No.  No.  You have to have the -- \nthe legislation that was passed prior that required safe storage, that \nensures that -- that a firearm is stored safely, is the same -- the same \nstandards are there.  Again, my bill only focuses on -- primarily, \nexcuse me, focuses on minors and those minors getting access to the \nfirearm.  \nMR. ANGELINO:  So what if there's a -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  So if you -- if you presently store \nit in a safe, if you use a locking mechanism that is approved, you're -- \nyou're still able to do that. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  But, that's sounds like I \nmust do that.  So, if I live home alone, I still have to secure my loaded \nweapon in some sort of manner?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Absolutely.  A hundred percent.  \nAnd that's pre this bill, in that regard. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  And does this mention \nowner?  I saw something about custodian?  What does \"custodian\" \nmean?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  I think it's safe to say the \ncustodian's an owner, but I want to make sure I double-check my \nnotes.  Give me one second.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n241(Pause)\nYeah.  So this bill doesn't change what's in current \nlaw in terms of ownership --\nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  Again --\nMR. ANDERSON:  -- and custodian.  So that \nwhatever presently exists, this doesn't change that.  Remember, we're \nonly dealing with minors here, for the most part, this legislation.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Right, but adults have to own the \nfirearm.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  I'm sorry?  \nMR. ANGELINO:  Only an adult can own the \nfirearm and we're trying to protect minors from obtaining it.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct.\nMR. ANGELINO:  So -- so adults are involved in \nthis. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  So am I responsible for \nmy firearm if I'm going on vacation and I take it to a friend's house, \nplease secure this while I'm away so nothing happens .  Am I still \nresponsible for that as the owner?  Or is he now the custodian and \nresponsible?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  That's a good question.  Let me \nlook at my notes.  It's a -- very good hypothetical.  Very important.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Yeah.  These are all things that \nhappen where I live. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n242MR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  \n(Pause)\nSo, let me just counter that with a question, just so I \ncan get to you -- to a better answer.  Is the person who's watching the \nfirearm the owner of the firearm?  Or is the person -- it is almost like \na -- I don't want to use the word \"babysitting\", but -- \nMR. ANGELINO:  No.  I -- I -- you're my neighbor, \nI'm going on vacation -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.\nMR. ANGELINO:  -- hey, I'm bringing over my \nexpensive jewelry and this is my prized shotgun.  Can you please \nsafeguard this?  I'll be back in a week.  Am I now responsible, or are \nyou?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  The -- the onus is on the owner \nto -- to make sure that it's secure.\nMR. ANGELINO:  That's a problem.  But -- \notherwise, I can't take it with me.  TSA really frowns on that.  So, \nagain, another common thing:  firearms displayed in the open.  Family \nheirloom that's still a working hunting rifle or shotgun, up above the \nfireplace and has a trigger lock on it.  Is that safely stored?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  No, it would need to be safely \nstored.\nMR. ANGELINO:  In here someplace, it -- I read \nwhere it has to be -- a trigger lock is considered a locking device. \nMR. ANDERSON:  That's one of many. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n243MR. ANGELINO:  But that's a storage device in here \nif it's trigger locked. \nMR. ANDERSON:  One moment, I'm going to check \nmy notes.\n(Pause) \nMR. ANGELINO:  I'll be going over 15.  Thank you. \nMR. ANDERSON:  So when we're -- I'm sorry?  So, \nwhen we were talking about \"safe depository,\" it is defined as a safe \nor other secure container which, when locked, is incapable of being \nopened without the key, keypad, combination, or other unlocking \nmechanism and is capable of preventing any unauthorized person \nfrom obtaining access to the possession of the weapon contained \ntherein, and they're -- and shall be fire, impact, or tamper resistance.  \nSo that's what's on statute presently. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  The -- and let me just get \nthis one out of the way because this is going to be a question I'm \ngonna get asked.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Firearms displayed in museums?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Firearms displayed in museums? \nMR. ANGELINO:  Yes. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Do they require -- are you asking \nif they're required to be safely stored?  Or what the safe storage \nstandards are for fire -- \nMR. ANGELINO:  Can they still be displayed 24/7 \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n244and when the museum is closed?  That's gonna get asked.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  Technically, yes.  So \nyou're thinking about a museum, it's there for historical purposes, it's \nthere for individuals to study, yes. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Yes, it has to be -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yes, it has to be stored -- \n(Conferencing)\nYes.\nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  This is causing a lot of \nhandling of firearms and that -- you know, that -- that's a dangerous \nsituation, too, the more they get handled.  Section 4, line 32, that \nrepeals -- correct me if I'm wrong, people under 18 with hunting \nlicenses. \nMR. ANDERSON:  If you look further down on page \n3, it's re-added further down in the bill. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  Which brings me to \nthe next -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  So -- \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Okay.  Go Ahead.\nMR. ANGELINO:  So that brings me to the next.  \nCurrently, Environmental Conservation Law allows 16- and 17-year \n-olds to hunt alone.  Is that still going to be allowed?\n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  So if you look at page 3, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n245Sections 20 to 23, a rifle or shotgun for lawful use as authorized by \nArticle 11 of the Environmental Conservation Law, when such person \nless than 18 years of age is the holder of a hunter's license or permit, \nsuch rifle or shotgun is used in accordance with such law.  So that \nanswers your question.\nMR. ANGELINO:  So that's an exception -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Uh-huh.\nMR. ANGELINO:  -- because if it's safely stored at \nhome, there is a 16 or 17 year old that does have access, correct?  \nThey can hunt alone.  They have to have access to it. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  Thank you.  In my district, \nthere's a lot of people -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. ANGELINO:  -- from your neck of the woods, \nthat own collective hunting camps.  And, you know, they'll show up, \nmaybe five or six owners and they're a favorite target of burglary.  It \ndrives us nuts.  People leave their firearms there legally locked in a \nsafe and a window gets broken and the safe gets carried away.  Are \nthey responsible?  There's a burglary, they were locked in a gun vault \nand still stolen.  And is --\n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  So -- so if the -- and I'm \njust assuming in this -- in this example, that the owner properly \nsecured their firearm, then they wouldn't be involved in this in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n246terms of this piece of legislation. \nMR. ANGELINO:  This is the unlawful entry \nsection -- exception.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  That -- that happens a lot. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm. \nMR. ANGELINO:  I believe that's all the questions I \nhave, but I would like to go on the bill briefly.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.  And \nyou're -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  -- gonna buzz.  So \nyou could go over after the buzzer.\nMR. ANGELINO:  I think I went over like two \nseconds ago.  Thank you -- \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  No, not yet.  \nMR. ANGELINO:  Okay.  Thank you, ma'am.  \nOn the bill.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. ANGELINO:  I know everybody's thinking that \nwhere I live, there's not a lot of people shooting other people.  \nHowever, what is needed and gets used often and firearms are need \nreadily-available, a lot of my farm families have very valuable animals \nand they have alarms set up in barns and areas like that.  And when \nthat alarm goes off, a motion or whatever, they have to quickly \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n247dispatch a predator.  And that happens often.  And this -- I -- they're \nprobably just going to ignore this because those animals are worth a \nmisdemeanor charge.  You know, they're thousands of dollars; either \nhorse, sheep or livestock and cattle.  But I'm not gonna get on the \ntangent of self-protection because that's a -- that's a whole 'nother \ngame.  I understand the intent of this.  It's -- it -- a lot of people where \nI live will consider this an infringement.  But I yield back my time, \nMadam Speaker.  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Gallahan.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWill the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Only if you cook for me, Mr. \nGallahan.\n(Laughter)\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  Everybody (indiscernible) many \ntimes?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  All right.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  Absolutely.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yes, sir.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  I -- I just needed a couple of \nquestions answered for clarification.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n248MR. ANDERSON:  Certainly.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  Page 1, line 45, this is \nconsidered a violation.  And then on page 3, line 24, it is considered a \nClass A misdemeanor.  There's some confusion there for me.\n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  So A misdemeanor across the \nboard in terms of lack of safe storage, which is a new addition, very \nimportant -- violation, excuse me.  And then the misdemeanor comes \ninto play if a minor gets access to the firearm. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  Okay.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  Thank you.  This pertains to \nfirearms in the home.  In 2000 -- what -- what -- from what I \nunderstand, in 2018 I started a team, a trap team at our local high \nschool and it's the New York State High School Trap Shooting \nAssociation.  And we have kids from 12 to 18 or -- or seniors could be \n19 years of age -- that are part of this program.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  We have 30 shooters.  And I'm \nwondering if any of this pertains to storage when those minors handle \nfirearms at the gun club?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  No, sir, Mr. Gallahan.  This does \nnot change current law in that regard. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  So the 16 and 17 year olds that \nhave driver's licenses that go home, pick up the firearm from the safe \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n249and drive that firearm in their vehicle to the gun club, are not in \nviolation?\n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  So to your point, Mr. Gallahan, \nif they're at the range with supervision, then they're totally fine with \nthis piece of legislation.  The issue comes into play when traveling \nwith the firearm. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  (Indiscernible) -- I'm sorry?\nMR. ANDERSON:  Which is not okay under current \nlaw.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  Can -- can you repeat that?  I -- I \ndidn't hear you, I'm sorry.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  So, if a 16 -- in your \nexample, if a 16 or 17-year-old is driving with a firearm not properly \nsecure, that's not -- in -- this law wouldn't change anything that \npresently exists with -- with traveling. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  So as long as it's properly stored \nin the vehicle, transporting it from the home to the gun club, alone, as \na minor, is -- is legal? \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  So, again, this -- Mr. \nGallahan, this doesn't change anything under current law.  A 16 or a \n17-year-old can't drive with a firearm in the car presently -- \npresently -- presently.  \nMR. GALLAHAN:  I would beg to differ that.  I \nchecked with our local law enforcement when -- when I -- when I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n250started this club, because we had kids driving and was told by our \nlocal sheriff that if they have a valid driver's license, they have the gun \nstored in the vehicle in a case, that is legal.\nMR. ANDERSON:  In this -- but in this example, is \nthe -- is the teen supervised or unsupervised?\nMR. GALLAHAN:  Unsupervised.\nMR. ANDERSON:  No adult with the -- with the \nteen? \nMR. GALLAHAN:  No, sir. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  My -- I mean, my \nlegislation doesn't interact in that -- in that way.  \nMR. GALLAHAN:  It does not interact -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  This is not -- no.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  So, the same thing would go for \na -- a -- a -- a minor that would be going squirrel hunting.  \nTransporting the -- the -- the firearm in the vehicle, to the field that his \nparents own or whatever.  He has a valid hunting license, he has his -- \nhis training -- New York State hunting training certificate, fully legal \nto -- to hunt small game by himself after the age of 16 -- or 17- or \n18-year-old kid, same thing would apply there, correct?\n(Conferencing)\nMR. ANDERSON:  That's a good question again, Mr. \nGallahan.  So, just to be very, very clear, this doesn't change current \nlaws relating to hunting.  If you look at pages 2 and 3, there's \ncarveouts specifically for hunting in individuals who are under the age \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n251of 18 and hunt.  And it just makes sure that those individuals are not \nencapsulated by this legislation.\nMR. GALLAHAN:  Okay.  Thank you very much for \nanswering my questions.  I appreciate it.  \nOn the bill.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  I also have the same concerns \nthat -- that my colleague that just debated the bill has.  And quite \nfrankly, we have a lot of older folks in my neighborhoods.  No \nchildren in their homes.  They -- they feel the need for protection \nand -- and I know several of my constituents have firearms behind \ntheir bedroom doors and I -- I just don't see them trying to conform \nwith this law.  But I -- I will be able to fully explain this to them now.  \nAnd -- and I appreciate the -- the sponsor answering my questions so \nthat I know there's no changes to the -- the system that we're currently \nusing.  I checked with local law enforcement to make sure that we \nwere within the confines of the law with our drivable students.  And I \nhave to put a shameless plug in:  Sunday afternoon I did take that team \nto Cicero, New York, for the New York State Trap Shooting \nChampionships.  And our little school that graduates 55 kids finished \nsecond in the State.  So, thank you, Madam Speaker.\n(Applause)\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Congratulations.  \nMr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n252the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly, Mr. Molitor.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Mr. Anderson.  So I -- I \nwasn't here when this original legislation got passed, but I -- I got \nsome questions that mostly have to do with page 2 and some of the \nexceptions that were added into the law. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly.  But -- just -- I wasn't \nhere either.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  All right.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  That makes two of us.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Two of us.  So I just want to make \nsure I understand this.  If I have a firearm in my house, it has to be in \nsafe storage at all times?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct.  Correct.\nMR. MOLITOR:  And \"safe storage\" means what \nagain?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  I can read that definition for you.  \nGive me one second.\n(Pause)\nAll right.  (Reading) A gun must be stored in a safe \nstorage depository or rendering incapable of being fired by use of a \ngun locking device appropriate to that weapon.  This could include \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n253simple devices such as a cable lock, which often come with guns \nwhen they are sold, or if you don't have one, they cost as little as $10 \nand can be locked with a key.  A safe storage depository, in terms of \nits legal definition, which I think that's what you're getting at, Mr. \nMolitor, is defined as a \"safe or other secure container which, when \nlocked, is incapable of being opened without the key, keypad, \ncombination, or any other locking mechanism and is capable of \npreventing an unauthorized person from obtaining access to the \npossession of the weapon contained therein, and shall be fire impact \nand tamper resistant.\"  So, if you want, you can get biometrics, too.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Biometric safe.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  And if I -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Those are a little bit more \nexpensive than the $10 locks. \nMR. MOLITOR:  I understand.  And if I don't \ncomply with that law, it's a noncriminal violation; isn't that correct?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yes, it's a noncriminal violation \nif you don't comply with the law.  And then the misdemeanor comes \nin with a child, when a child is involved. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And one of the exceptions \nto that violation is on -- on page 2, line 40, (Reading) If a person \nobtained the firearm, rifle, or shotgun as a result of unlawful entry by \nany person. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n254MR. MOLITOR:  So -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  And self-defense is -- is another \none of the -- \nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah.  Well -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  -- right below it. \nMR. MOLITOR:  -- we might get there.  We'll see -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  I'm trying to understand here.  So -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Let me not get ahead of you, \nMr. Molitor.\nMR. MOLITOR:  So in the -- in the event that there's \nunlawful entry into my home, I'm allowed to obtain a weapon that \ndoesn't necessarily need to be in safe storage at that moment?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  I don't understand the question, \nMr. Molitor.  Can you rephrase it? \nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah.  So let's say every day I kept \nmy, you know, handgun on my nightstand.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Every day of the year I would be in \nviolation of this law, except that one moment in which somebody \nenters my home unlawfully.  Under this, that I would not be in \nviolation of the law; is that correct?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  That's correct.  And I just want \nyou to understand that this -- we're not having police go into \neverybody's house and check and -- and -- and proactive in that sense.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n255MR. MOLITOR:  Yeah.\nMR. ANDERSON:  We're just trying to create a \nculture where individuals know to lock up their firearms, to store \nsafely, et cetera.  Similar to the campaign that was run before my time \naround seat belts, making sure that people understand the importance \nof wearing a seat belt.  This is exactly the culture that we're trying to \npromote in terms of safe storage. \nMR. MOLITOR:  And so let's take the second \nexception -- and I understand all that, let's take the second exception.  \nEvery day of the year that I keep my handgun in my car, I would be in \nviolation of the law, except for that circumstance where somebody \nmaybe tries to take my car from me at gunpoint.  And then, in that \ncase, because I'm defending myself, I'm complying with the -- with the \nself-defense laws of the State of New York, I would not be in \nviolation of the law.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  So I think -- I think your \nhypothetical goes out of the bounds of the exceptions that I'm talking \nabout.  This is really about safe storage. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So both of my hypotheticals -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  No.  Just that last one.\nMR. MOLITOR:  That last one does not?\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yes -- \nMR. MOLITOR:  Isn't rob -- isn't -- isn't self-defense \nfor robbery a permissible use of -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  No.  The -- the example you \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n256gave was with traveling, no?  \nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah.  I -- under your law, I'm \nrequired to keep my firearm in -- in storage when I'm in a vehicle; am \nI not?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Bu, if someone's trying to rob me \nof my vehicle, I can use that weapon in self-defense.  And if it's not -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Self-defense, correct.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  -- and if it's not in safe storage, I \nwould not be in violation of this law?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct.  Self-defense exception.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you for \nanswering my questions, Mr. Anderson.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly. \nMR. MOLITOR:  On the bill.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  So, you know, I understand the \npurpose of this law.  And I -- you know, I -- I do think making the -- \nthe punishment for violating this law a violation instead of a \nmisdemeanor, makes this law better.  My concern is that you're asking \nNew Yorkers in this bill to make a judgment  call.  Should they, you \nknow, put a lock on their weapon, on their firearm, or put, you know, \ntheir firearm in -- in a -- in a biometric safe?  Which, by the way, \ndoesn't work all the time.  I have one, it doesn't work all the time.  \nAnd you're asking them to make a judgment  call about something that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n257they cannot predict.  You cannot predict when somebody else in this \nworld is going to perpetuate violence against you and this puts people \nin incredibly compromising situations.  Yes, nobody wants a firearm \nto be used by a minor in a terrible situation like suicide.  I mean, \nthat -- that's just terrible.  Nobody wants that to happen.  But, you \nknow, if you're trying to protect yourself and you're trying to protect \nyour home and your family, you sometimes have to make -- you \nsometimes make this judgment  call that I would rather have my \nweapon easily accessible to me so that I can defend my home and my \nfamily, then, you know, maybe put a safety device on it that isn't \nnecessarily -- or this -- that's gonna create more problems.  \nYou know, as I mentioned many times, I -- I've been \na prosecutor.  Burglaries in the middle of the night from complete \nstrangers happen more often than you think.  They're terrifying \nsituations.  If you've never seen Night Stalker  on Netflix about \nRichard Ramirez, I suggest you watch it.  You will purchase a firearm \nafter watching that.  \nSo for all those reasons and because I also think this \nviolates the 2nd Amendment, I'll be voting in the negative.  Thank \nyou.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Bailey. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield for a couple of questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n258yield?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Only for you, Ms. Bailey. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  Well, I've heard you say that once \nbefore, but I'll -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Uh-oh -- \nMRS. BAILEY:  -- I'll just pretend this is the first \ntime I heard it today.\nMR. ANDERSON:  -- oh, I'm getting in trouble now.  \nI'm cheating.  \n(Laughter)\nGo ahead.\nMRS. BAILEY:  So I -- I just -- as I sit here and \nlisten, I just -- I just need some clarity.  So in 2022, CCIA came out \nand that is where this safe storage portion of this legislation came into \nplay under 265 that you're looking to make some changes to.  Aside \nfrom the reporting and the data that will be collected, aside from \nchanging the failure to safely store rifles, shotguns and firearms from a \nfirst degree -- Class A misdemeanor, now it's a violation and then \nadding pieces as to when you could do it, I -- I'm stuck on the \"minor\" \nportion of it.  And -- and as my colleagues have said, it's absolutely a \ntravesty what happened, but when I'm reading the legislation the way \nthat it was written in 2022, was that not already the intent of the -- of \nthe legislation that was put forward?\nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly.  And so, in addition to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n259that, going back to my cool little acronym that I made up with this bill, \nADD; accountability, data, deterrence, right?  And so, what this piece \nof legislation does is it aligns it with the gold standard of safe storage.  \nSo we already have safe storage laws, but this further perfects it so \nthat individuals who are in households -- let's say I'm an individual, \nand I visit a friend's house.  I'm covered under this law if an individual \nwhose house I go and visit doesn't properly, you know, lock their \nfirearm.  That was a loophole that wasn't covered prior.  And in -- in \nthis instance, if -- if you look at the -- the sponsor's memo, I talk about \nthe story of Francesco, where this painful incident took place.  And -- \nand so, what we're trying to do is just protect, to ensure that -- that that \ntype of instance doesn't happen again. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  So then, I guess my next \nquestion is going to lead me to during -- when CCIA was enacted, the \nState Police, along with DCJS, were charged with making many \nimplementations.  One thing that they did a great job with was some \nfrequently asked questions, pieces of it.  So specifically, I guess what \nI'm -- I'm looking at to help guide residents back at home, when we're \nlooking at the frequently asked questions that they had put out under:  \n\"How am I required to store my guns in my home?\"  it specifically \nsays, \"If anyone younger than 18 years old or anyone who is \nprohibited from possessing a gun resides in the home, all firearms -- \nall firearms, rifles and shotguns, not in your immediate control, must \neither be\" but then it goes on to state that you are -- you are \nresponsible even if those individuals are in your home.  So I guess \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n260your intent is to make it clearer if I have -- if my son invites a friend \nover who is a minor, to ensure that our guns safely stored?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMRS. BAILEY:  Is that -- that's the part that I'm \nstruggling with.  I thought -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.\nMRS. BAILEY:  -- that the legislation already \ncovered that. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.  So, \"clarifies,\" number \none and number two, if you look at page 3, lines 40 to 47, specifically \nwe're looking to collect data -- \nMRS. BAILEY:  Absolutely.\nMR. ANDERSON:  -- in these instances.  So that's \nimportant, right?  Presently we don't collect data.  So what my bill \ndoes is it directs the DCJS, the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, \nwhich is newly moved into that agency respectively, to begin to \ncollect data.  And also to begin a campaign of sorts to educate \nindividuals.  So that kind of answers one of your other -- one of the \nother questioner's question about how, you know, we would educate \nthe -- the masses, if you will, our constituents, if you will, about the \nspecifics and the particulars.  So it charges that agency to do that as \nwell. \nMRS. BAILEY:  Okay.  Thank you.  I have another \nquick question.  So -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n261MRS. BAILEY:  -- I see that we're only amending \nSection 265 with this piece of legislation.  Also under Penal Law \n400.18, as far as notice upon issuance of a license, specifically in and \naround pistol permits.  There is communication that must be handed \nout to all permit holders.  Based on your legislation, does -- is that -- \ndo you anticipate that that communication is going to be altered as far \nas of the wording that is in it?\nMR. ANDERSON:  No.  \nMRS. BAILEY:  So your bill meets -- it -- it aligns \nwith that --  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMRS. BAILEY:  -- correct?  Okay.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yup. \nMRS. BAILEY:  And I believe that -- those were my \nquestions.  Thank you very much.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Thank you, Ms. Bailey. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Reilly. \nMR. REILLY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  I said -- we won't put it on the \nrecord.  Go ahead -- \nMR. REILLY:  You can.  You can.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n262MR. REILLY:  I actually have -- I actually just have \ntwo questions.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.\nMR. REILLY:  And it's basically piggybacking off of \nwhat Ms. Bailey said.  So the law mandates distribution of safe \nstorage materials. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct.\nMR. REILLY:  Who's gonna be responsible -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  DCJS, Office of Gun Violence \nPrevention. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  Is there -- is there funding \nallocated for that?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  No.  This is a function of the \noffice already, to -- to do public information campaigns and PSAs.\nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  Who are they going to -- who's \nthe -- who is the campaign going to target?  Is it going to be mailers?  \nIs it going to be TV?\nMR. ANDERSON:  I -- I can't get into the specifics \nof the different strategies that the agency uses.  They have variety of \ndifferent tools.  It could be PSAs, it could be commercials, it could be \nmailers, it can be paperclips.  It could be, you know, key chains.  I \ndon't know how they're gonna do it.  \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  So we're not -- we're not \ndelineating in this legislation -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  No.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n263MR. REILLY:  -- what they're gonna -- how they're \ngonna do it?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Nope.  \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  Second piece -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  But I hope they do -- \nMR. REILLY:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.\nMR. ANDERSON:  -- I hope they do a good job, \nbecause that's gonna be the most important thing in getting the \ninformation out.  \nMR. REILLY:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So the data \ncollection mandate.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. REILLY:  So states in there that the Office of \nGun Violence Prevention, right, is going to collect the data.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly.\nMR. REILLY:  What specific data are we looking at?  \nWill it be those incidents that happen with -- with licensed-owned \nfirearms and those firearms that are legally held, too?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Instances where an individual is \ncharged with either a violation or a Class A misdemeanor for the \nwrongful access to unsafely stored firearm.  So that -- that data, we \nwant to make sure that the State is collecting it so that we're \ncontinuing to actively course correct.  If we see a cluster of this issue \nhappening in the area, the agency will come out, do education and \nthings of that like. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n264MR. REILLY:  Okay.  So it'll -- it'll encompass any \nincident involving a firearm, whether it was legally owned or illegally \nowned. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  All right.  Will local law \nenforcement agencies be required to submit that data to any -- to the \nOffice of Gun Violence?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Presently, local law -- so, DCJS \nserves as the central police agency for the State.  So all data from all \npolice forces go to DCJS presently.  So this will just be adhered to \nthat. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  So the -- the mechanisms \nalready there?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. REILLY:  Okay.  All right.   \nMR. ANDERSON:  I'm -- I'm tight here.  We're well \nwrapped. \nMR. REILLY:  Absolutely.  Thank you, Mr.  \nAnderson.  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Thank you, Mr. Reilly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Lemondes.  \nMR. LEMONDES:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWill the sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n265yield?\nMR. ANDERSON:  Only if you take me to your \nsheep farm, Mr. Lemondes.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. LEMONDES:  I fully intend to, Mr. Anderson.  \nThank you.  A couple of things with regard to this bill.  If I understand \ncorrectly based on everything else that's taken place, if I'm defending \nmyself, my weapon doesn't have to be secured, correct?  Within my \nhome. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct. \nMR. LEMONDES:  So how does one know when \nthey're going to be in the act of defending themself from a home \ninvasion?  Typically people that are breaking in don't telegraph and \ntell you in advance.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  You know, with this \nhypothetical, Mr. Lemondes, I just want to be really careful.  Police in \nmy legislation -- we're not having police go door to door to check if \nfolks are safely storing and securing their firearm.  We're trying to \nmerely encourage folks to do the right thing.  And of course, if you \nknow somebody that's not doing the right thing, as Legislators, we're \nall mandated reporters. \nMR. LEMONDES:  So let me ask the question \ndifferently then.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.  \nMR. LEMONDES:  And I was going to get to who is \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n266responsible for enforcement and how would enforcement -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  Understood.  \nMR. LEMONDES:  -- be -- undertaken.  I'll come \nback to that.  Again, so, I go to my home tonight, I go to sleep because \nyou're coming over to visit my farm tomorrow morning -- \nMR. ANDERSON:  If they let me out of here.\nMR. LEMONDES:  -- and somebody invades -- \nsomebody invades my home, but my weapons are secure.  Do you \nknow what the home invasion standard is before the advantage goes to \nthe person breaking in versus the -- the inhabitance of the dwelling?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  I don't -- I don't know if that's \ngermane to the bill, Mr. Lemondes.  I think what I'm looking for and \n-- and we're trying to accomplish is, again, the safe standards as it \nrelates to security.  Of course, you're not gonna get a heads-up about a \ninvasion, just as much you won't get a heads-up about an earthquake \nand -- and we still have to purchase earthquake insurance or flood \ninsurance.  So, I mean, that's -- that's the challenges that stand in the \nway. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Right.  We can disagree about \nthe germaneness.  It's less than ten seconds, for the record.  So, I don't \nknow about you, but I couldn't flip the dial on my gun safe from my \nbed in less than ten seconds when somebody's invading my home. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Well -- well -- and -- and keep in \nmind though, Mr. Lemondes, and I actually have a little photo here, \nthere are many, many different tools that you can use to safely store \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n267your firearm.  It could be biometrics, which I think one of your \ncolleagues said is a little difficult, it could be the $10 lock.  There's a \nvariety of different ways you could use the technology that exists \npresently if you need to access your firearm in -- in a quick manner. \nMR. LEMONDES:  I'll tell you, this is not germane.  \nI'm gonna put this question out very simply without expecting an \nanswer.  If you have ever had your home invaded, it's very stressful \nand I can speak from personal experience.  I have.  This bill would \npreempt one from protecting themself and their family.  If it was \nfollowed to the letter, it would preempt that, or preclude that, excuse \nme. \nMR. ANDERSON:  I -- I respectfully disagree, Mr. \nLemondes.  \nMR. LEMONDES:  Of course, I would expect so.  \nBut I'll tell you, even with all of my training in the military, everything \nthat I've done, a home invasion when you're home, home home home, \nright here in New York, is very, very stressful.  And it takes a lot of \ndiscipline that the average person doesn't have, to deal with that \nsuccessfully.  Anyways, I understand the intent of this.  I think the \nintent is noble; however, the execution, I believe, is faulty.  One other \nquestion, in the sponsor's memo, it mentioned data collection.  Who is \ncollecting data from whom and to whom?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yeah.  So, number one, DCJS \npresently, again, is the centralized police force -- the police data \ncollection entity for the State of New York.  So for -- for the first part \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n268of your question, police forces already across the State are reporting to \nDCJS that data.  Number two, District Attorneys are a part of that \necosystem, so data will be reported by them as well and this will help \ninform us where instances of this issue is existing. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Okay.  Let me peel that back a \nlittle further.  Does this bill require firearm owners to report every \nfirearm, by type, that they have in their home?\nMR. ANDERSON:  It does not.  That's not germane \nto this bill.  It does not. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Is there any other data that's \nrequired that the -- that the firearm and/or homeowner is required to \nreport?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  No. \nMR. LEMONDES:  Okay.  Mr. Anderson, thank you \nfor you questions.  \nMadam -- Mr. Speaker, on the bill.   \nACTING SPEAKER MR. EACHUS:  On the bill.\nMR. LEMONDES:  I simply can't support this for \nmultiple reasons.  I think it defeats the purpose and as has been said \nby one of my colleagues already, I believe that it's in violation of the \nSecond Amendment.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Thank you.\nMr. Manktelow.  \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  \nWould the sponsor yield?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n269ACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. ANDERSON:  I will yield. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Mr. Anderson.\nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  He yields.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Thank you, Mr.  Anderson.  \nThank you, Mr. Speaker.  Just for a couple points of clarification, just \nso I understand this.  So I have my grandfather's shotgun that was \ngiven to me.  It's above the mantle above my wood stove.  Can it be up \nthere?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Yup.  It can be up there as long \nas it has a safety lock on it. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  So as long as it has a safety \nlock on it of some sorts, it can be up there?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Correct.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  Perfect, thank you.  My \nsecond question --\nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  You had talked to I think my \ncolleague earlier on about museums and stuff like that.  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Certainly.\nMR. MANKTELOW:  And did I hear you -- what -- \nwhat happens with the guns that are at a museum at the close of -- of \nthe museum?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Nothing.  This is not germane to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n270the bill on that specific example that you've given and the reason \nbeing is because, when you have the functions of a museum, is for \nlearning and history, it's not for use and those guns wouldn't be \nactivated or be able to be used.  You can't use them, they're just for \nshow. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  Okay.  So like -- like the ones \nthat are at the New York State Military Museum up in Saratoga. \nMR. ANDERSON:  Sure.  \nMR. MANKTELOW:  They're in glass cases.  That's \nall acceptable?  \nMR. ANDERSON:  Mm-hmm. \nMR. MANKTELOW:  All right.  Thank you for your \nanswer.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Thank you. \nA Party vote has been requested.  \nMr. Gandolfo. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The \nRepublican Conference will generally be opposed to this piece of \nlegislation; however any members who wish to vote yes may do so at \ntheir desks. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Mr. Lavine.  \nMR. LAVINE:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  So the \nMajority Conference will generally be voting in the affirmative on this \nparticular bill and if any of the Majority members want to vote \notherwise, they are invited to go to their desks and vote in the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n271negative.  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMr. Anderson to explain your vote.\nMR. ANDERSON:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  \nFrancesco didn't have an opportunity to live to the age of 18 and as -- \nit's painful that we even have to have this particular piece of \nlegislation in his memory.  And as his parents and loved ones sits in \nthis Chamber and listen to today's debate, I know it's heart-wrenching.  \nBut this piece of legislation ensures that we can hold individuals \naccountable and that we can encourage safe storage in the State of \nNew York.  New York should be leading the way.  We should be \nliving at the gold standard here in the State of New York with safe \nstorage, and I think that my piece of legislation accomplishes that and \nI commend the family for sharing their trauma, their pain and their \nstruggles for the weeks that they spent here in Albany.  I thank my \ncolleagues and their variety of opinions and I thank one of my \ncolleagues who worked tirelessly to ensure that we can have this fight \nhere today.  I withdraw my request and proudly vote in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Mr. Anderson in the \naffirmative. \nMs. Chandler-Waterman. \nMS. CHANDLER-WATERMAN:  Mr. Speaker, as \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n272we recognize June as Gun Violence Awareness Month, we must take \nin account all incidents where gun violence is at play with illegal guns \nand legal gun ownership.  We must take into account and address that \nillegal guns are infiltrating our communities, which unfortunately are \nused for most shootings in districts like mine.  We also must address \nlegal gun owners and ensure that guns are safely stored, especially \nwhere minors are present.  Francesco was a young man with a bright \nfuture and if we had this law in place, he would be with us today.  \nFrancesco died by suicide in 2021 with an unsecure firearm.  He was \njust 17 years old and was a victim of bullying because of his sexual \norientation.  Between 2020 -- 2016 and 2021, suicides accounted for \n36 percent of firearm related death among children ages ten to 19 \nyears of age.  Implementing and enforcing safe storage laws promote a \nculture of responsible gun ownership.  Furthermore, 66 percent of \nunintentional, fatal firearm shootings involving children occurred \nwhen the firearm was being handled or shown by someone else.  No \none here would ever want to be in a situation as a gun owner where \ntheir gun is used by a child out of curiosity or a moment of crisis and \nthen die.  I appreciate the hard work of the sponsor, my colleague, \nAssemblymember, Khaleel Anderson, and for his family.  His mom \nwho's here today, who turned her pain into purpose so we can say one \nday, not another child.  I will vote in the affirmative and I encourage \nall my colleagues to do the same.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. \nChandler-Waterman in the affirmative.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n273Mr. Dinowitz to explain you. \nMR. DINOWITZ:  I am -- I am so happy we are \npassing this today.  While it's too late for Francesco and other people \nwho should not have died, this bill can help make sure that there are \nother people who won't die in the future.  And for Francesco's family \nand for those who worked so hard to make this bill happen, just know \nthat some lives, we won't know whose, will be saved when this is \nsigned into law.  And I also want to say, I appreciate very much the \nincredible work done by the sponsor of this bill.  He should be very \nproud.  I vote yes. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Mr. Dinowitz in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Seawright to explain your vote. \nMS. SEAWRIGHT:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for \nallowing me to explain my vote.  Families all across our State deserve \nthe greater protections that Francesco's Law would provide from \nimproperly stored and unsecured firearms.  Francesco was a brilliant, \nkind and talented young man who you've heard grew up on Long \nIsland.  And in October of 2021, he took his own life with a family \nmember's unsecured firearm after experiencing relentless bullying \nover his bisexuality.  He was only 17 years of age.  Too many children \nand young people have died across our nation as a result of gaining \naccess to a loaded firearm that was left unsecured.  No parent like \nFrancesco's mother, Diana, who's in the Chamber today and \nGodmother, Jennifer, who's here with us, should ever have to go \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n274through the pain of losing their child because a gun owner carelessly \nfailed to secure and storely safe their gun.  I am proud to cast my vote \ntoday in honor of Francesco's Law and I thank the bill's sponsor for all \nof his hard work and the advocates and the mother and Godmother for \ntheir work in making this bill a reality.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. Seawright in \nthe affirmative.  \nMs. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas to explain your vote. \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  \nFrancesco's story hit me hard as a parent of a teenager who's also \nbisexual and also bullied and the fact that he had access to an \nunsecured firearm shows the challenges that we face in this country.  \nWe're facing both an environment where children are relentlessly \nbullied for their gender and sexuality and their expression and we're \nfacing a mental health crisis amongst our young people.  All the while \nwhere firearms are not locked away and secured.  I want to thank the \nsponsor for his relentless advocacy from the heart and his parents who \nshared their pain, over and over again, to make sure that no further \nchild would experience this and in honor of Francesco and the \ncountless other children whose lives were lost due to an unsecure \nfirearm.  I'm proud to vote in the affirmative and I urge my colleagues \nto do so as well.  Thank you so much. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas \nin -- in the affirmative.\nMr.  Gallahan to explain your vote. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n275MR. GALLAHAN:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I have \nseveral firearms, every one of them is securely secured and the reason \nfor that wasn't a law 50 years ago when I -- when I had my first \nfirearm.  The reason for that was education.  Education when I took \nmy hunter safety course.  Education that has been -- been improved \nover the years and now mandated when you have an application for a \npistol permit.  Two-and-a-half days of training.  The same thing with a \nsemiautomatic rifle, training.  I would ask, this is the second ask I've \nhad this -- this -- this year, my colleagues on the other side to sit down \nwith me and construct education in high schools, just like the health \nclass, that teaches each and every child in our school system firearm \nsafety.  Nothing is a substitute for education.  Nothing.  Responsible \ngun owners lock their guns away and they're gonna continue to lock \ntheir guns away.  But these children that come up through, when they \nfind a firearm, or they see a firearm and they're not trained, do they \nknow what to do?  Do they know what not to do?  Do they know who \nto report it to?  They will if we educate them.  An education in our \nschools will save many lives.  Thank you, Ms. Speaker.  \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  How do you vote?  \nMR. GALLAHAN:  I'll be in the negative on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Mr. Gallahan in the \nnegative.\nMs. Lunsford to explain your vote.\nMS. LUNSFORD:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  You \nknow, I was trying to find some statistics about how many shootings \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n276there are in home invasions versus children who accidentally shoot \nthemselves and I really couldn't find statistics.  So I thank the sponsor \nfor putting data collection in here because we don't really have this \ninformation, we just hear anecdotal stories.  But what I do know, is \nthat 80 percent of gun owners support safe storage laws.  Responsible \ngun owners safely store their weapons, that's what you do.  But yet, \naccording to a study last year, 43 percent of households still store \nloaded guns and just under half have guns loaded with ammunition \nnot in lockers.  Don't responsible gun owners want everybody to be \nresponsible?  Don't we want this for people?  For everyone to act the \nway responsible people would?  This mandate will not only allow us \nto provide more education and to put some teeth behind it, but it will \nattach liability for situations where people are not being responsible \nand it leads to unintentional deaths.  That's what this is for.  It's \nimportant.  And I've said this on this floor before and I'm gonna say it \nagain, the reason so many toddlers shoot themselves is because their \nindex fingers are too weak and they turn the gun around to use their \nthumb.  And if that doesn't haunt you, I don't know what will. \nIn addition to that, in addition to accidental firearm \ndeaths and suicides, according to a Department of Justice article about \nsafe storage gun laws for 2023, the majority of individuals who \ncarried out a K-12 mass shooting obtained the firearms used in the \nshooting from a family member in an unsecured gun.  Further, \nbetween 2005 and 2010, in home burglaries and other property \ncrimes, 1.4 million firearms were stolen.  Safe storage helps that, too.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n277I don't know why anyone would oppose us safely storing guns.  It \nsaves lives and it keeps illegal guns off the street.  I'll be voting in the \naffirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. Lunsford in the \naffirmative.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes to explain your vote. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, \nMr. Speaker, for the opportunity to explain my vote.  I want to \ncongratulate the sponsor of this legislation.  First of all, I think you did \nan amazing job of debating a very well-crafted bill and as a daughter \nof a mason, some masons were in our Chambers a few weeks ago, I \nwas trained and educated on how to use a weapon.  We went to the \nBig Hill Hunting and Fishing Club on a regular basis.  Not only did \nwe run track and play dodgeball, but we also learned how to shoot \nweapons and as a result of that, I, as an adult, am licensed, but I'm also \ngonna lock them up and keep them locked up.  And so, it was \nmentioned on this floor already once, I will mention it again:  A \nresponsible gun owner has no problem securing their weapons.  None.  \nAnd so, if there's someone who has a problem with that, then that \nmeans they're not responsible and they shouldn't have the weapon.  So \nI look forward to voting in the affirmative on this piece of legislation. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Mrs. \nPeoples-Stokes in the affirmative.  \nMs. Griffin to explain your vote.\nMS. GRIFFIN:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n278allowing me to explain my vote.  Thank you to Assemblymember \nAnderson for sponsoring this important legislation.  I'm proud to be a \ncosponsor and support this measure that will save lives.  Safe gun \nstorage is vital and this measure will pave the way.  Thank you \nFrancesco and his amazing family.  The courage his mom showed \nwhen she met with me to share the tragedy of losing her son was truly \nheartbreaking, but also inspiring that she could come to Albany, visit \nso many people and talk about that story over and over again.  So, I \njust want to say, thank you for coming here, thank you for setting an \nexample, thank you for your advocacy and I want to say, love to \nFrancesco, his memory and love to his family.  Thank you.  I vote -- \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. Griffin in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Schiavoni to explain your vote.  \nMR. SCHIAVONI:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  And I \nwant to applaud the -- the sponsor for bringing this law forward.  I -- I, \ntoo, believe in education; in fact, I made a career as an educator \ndealing with people whose frontal lobes are not fully developed.  I \nknow teenagers.  They're impulsive.  Coupled with our mental health \ncrisis that our children are facing, I believe that this law is more than \nappropriate at this time.  And I think about the people, the children \nthat I've known over my career who have died by suicide.  It's tough.  \nIt rocks a community.  And I do believe that safe storage laws do save \nlives, that they will save lives.  And had they been in place they would \nhave saved the lives of the young people that I've known.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n279Thank you.  I will be voting in the affirmative.  \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Mr. Schiavoni in \nthe affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \n(Applause)\nPage 20, Rules Report No. 588, the Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A08463-E, Rules \nReport No. 588, Lee, Kim, Taylor, Burdick, Glick, Levenberg, Colton, \nDe Los Santos, Zaccaro, Solages, Buttenschon, Epstein, \nGonz\u00e1lez-Rojas, Reyes, Braunstein, Kassay, Rozic, Rivera, Paulin, \nBores, Burroughs, Weprin, Rajkumar, Romero, Hooks, Jackson, \nSimone, Griffin, Chang, Raga.  An act in relation to authorizing the \nCommissioner of Education to conduct a survey regarding instruction \non Asian American, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islander history \nwithin the State; to amend the Education Law, in relation to \nestablishing an Asian American, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Island \nHistory Advisory Committee; and providing for the repeal of such \nprovisions upon the expiration thereof.\nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  An explanation has \nbeen requested. \nMs. Lee. \n(Pause)\nOn a motion by Ms. Lee, the Senate bill is before the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n280House.  The Senate bill is advanced.  \nMs. Lee for an explanation. \nMS. LEE:  Thank you.  This bill would authorize and \ndirect the Commissioner of Education to conduct a Statewide survey \nof school districts to determine the extent of instruction related to \nAsian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history, \nincluding curriculum content, grade-level instructional time and \nteacher training. \nThis bill would also establish a temporary advisory \ncommittee to recommend instructional resources and ways to \nstrengthen K through 12 education programs in AANHPI history. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for just a couple of questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. LEE:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  The sponsor yields.\nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.\nSo, I noticed that there -- as you mentioned in your \nexplanation there are two components; there's a report that will be \ngenerated of the findings and recommendations to implement or \nstrengthen such instruction, and that's gonna be delivered to the \nGovernor, the Temporary President of the Senate, the Speaker of the \nAssembly, the Minority Leader of the Senate and the Minority Leader \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n281of the Assembly by the first of January following the effective date, \ncorrect?  \nMS. LEE:  That's correct.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So -- and thank you for \nincluding the Minority Leaders in the receipt of that report. \nMy question is, when it comes to the composition of \nthe History Advisory Committee, which is comprised of four experts \non the topic, you don't have any Minority appointments on that.  So I \nwas just wondering why that is. \nMS. LEE:  Well, these appointments are not political.  \nI mean, they are about selecting experts on the subject matter that is \nrelevant to this bill.  And the Minority -- you or anyone else as \nmembers of the Minority are welcome to provide recommendations \nfor appointments. \nMS. WALSH:  We would provide recommendations \nto the Speaker of the Assembly who does have an appointment?  \nMS. LEE:  Sure.  The Speaker of the Assembly, the \nMajority Leader.  And really, these are appointments for subject \nmatter experts.  They can be Republicans, they can be Democrat.  The \nmost important thing about these appointments is that they are subject \nmatter experts in AANHPI history and curriculum. \nMS. WALSH:  Was there a reason why you -- you've \ngot four experts?  I mean, if you had six experts then you could \naccommodate the desire for the Minority to participate in being able \nto put appointments on as well.  Then you'd have six heads; isn't that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n282better than four heads?  \nMS. LEE:  Well, the way the bill is written, currently \nthe Governor gets an appointment, the Majority Leader of -- of -- the \nPresident gets -- of the Senate gets an appointment, the Speaker gets \nan appointment and the Commissioner of Education also gets an \nappointment.  \nMS. WALSH:  Right.\nMS. LEE:  But I guess what -- I mean, your interest -- \nI really appreciate deeply your interest in this bill and in AANHPI \ncurriculum because it is a bill about DEI; diversity, equity and \ninclusion.  So I assume that your interest in this bill also is as the -- for \nsupport of DEI in our -- in our State. \nMS. WALSH:  Well, I think it's always a little bit \nironic that when we talk about minorities that a lot of times you forget \n-- not you personally, but sometimes members of the Majority party \ntend to forget about the Minority party and whatever insights that \ncould be brought into any topic.  It feels a little a lonely sometimes, \nand so I just wanted to give you an opportunity to explain your \nthinking on this, and I appreciate your answers.\nAnd now, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to go on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, at the risk of sounding like a \nbroken record, and I -- I get the -- the irony a little bit that's being \nbrought up about trying to be culturally-competent and trying to \nencourage cultural competence when we are in, in some ways, an \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n283extremely dysfunctional governmental setup here sometimes.  And we \ncould use a little bit of -- a little bit of competence and respect for our \nside of the aisle.  And I think that having a member or two from the \nMinority to be able to nominate people that we know that are experts \non this topic I think would be a really refreshing thing.  So I didn't ask \nthe sponsor if she would be amenable to amending her bill to add \nthose members because it just didn't sound like she would.  So I didn't \nwant to just ask that additional question.  But I would love to see that.  \nAnd as you see in a number of bills that come up, these study bills, \nyou're gonna be hearing this song being played again and again.  And \nI -- when it gets listened to, your bills move without any opposition \nand we're happy to support them.  We're just saying that we want to \nmake a record and say that we -- we would also like to be heard.  We \nwould also like to be able to offer up our ideas, not through a conduit \nlike the Speaker or the Majority Leader, who are both wonderful \npeople, but by our own leadership.\nSo for that reason there may be some of us who may \nvote in the negative, although I think that the -- the idea itself for this \nsurvey is a good one.  \nSo I thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the sponsor \nfor her time.  Thanks. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Thank you.\nMr. Chang. \nMR. CHANG:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Would the \nsponsor yield?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n284ACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. LEE:  Yes. \nACTING SPEAKER EACHUS:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. CHANG:  Thank you, Ms. Lee.  Appreciate that \nyou and Senator Liu have come out with this -- with this bill itself to \nmake it -- our community, our Asian community, into education. \nNow, how will you propose this for expert itself?  \nBecause Asian is such a large, very large culture.  It's in at least three \ndifferent continents.  And it's very hard to have even four experts just \nto -- just to decide on what curriculum and topics. \nMS. LEE:  Well, first of all, I just want to thank my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle for being a cosponsor on this \nbill and supporting -- supporting this initiative on AANHPI \ncurriculum in our State.  We will have -- the focus really is on subject \nmatter experts of AANHPI curriculum.  The expectation is that they \nalso have -- you know, they have been -- they're -- they're experts of \nthis field.  So Asian American is a broad definition.  It includes many \ndifferent communities within the AAP -- AANHPI community.  And \nthere are people who have been -- who spent their lives, dedicated \ntheir lives to studying these communities, and that is what we will be \nlooking for.  Or that's what I hope the people who are set to make the \nappointments will be looking for as they make those appointments. \nMR. CHANG:  Well, I hope we can, as my fellow \ncolleagues, we'd like to see it broadened itself because I'd like to see \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n285some conservative family value itself.  And DEI is such a broad \nconcept.  And I don't believe in that, I believe in just who we are, what \nwe are, instead of just putting a label itself.  \nBut no, thank you very much, Ms. Lee, about this -- \nabout this bill.  Yes, I cosponsored this because we need to have the \nschool system to, especially in an area that doesn't have that many \nAsians Americans and understand our community.  We're -- the \nChinese have immigrated in this country about less than 200 years \nago; maybe 1830-ish to 1850.  So it's not that long.  And then only the \npast 50, 60 years that we have an influx of different community come \nin.  So maybe certain communities may not able [sic] to see what we \nare, what the differences are in Koreans and the Vietnamese.  And I \nhope the -- our mainstream will maybe have a chance to understand \nwhere our diverse culture and community are.  Because in this world \nwe represent the Asian community.  We represent maybe 60 -- 60 \npercent of the population, so it's not small.  But in the United States \nwe represent only 12 percent -- 12 percent in New York, less than 4 \npercent in -- in the United States.  So we're small but we're growing.  \nAnd thank you very much.\nOn the bill, ma'am. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. CHANG:  Yes.  Thank you for the sponsor to \npresent this, as well as the Senate, John Liu.  And -- and I just hope \nwe have a more expertise to decide what subject and what topic that \ncan be in the curriculum, because it's so broad.  Even for me, it's so \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n286much to wrap different Asian cultures -- and there's a lot -- even \nthough I traveled and lived in Asia for -- for over a decade, and I'm \nstill learning different Asian cultures. \nThank you very much.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Lee. \n(Pause)\nRead the last section. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMs. Lee to explain her vote. \nMS. LEE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nOne of the most unforgettable moments of my time in \nAlbany was meeting a group of young Asian American students who \ncame up from New York City to advocate for inclusive curriculum to \nlawmakers here in Albany.  They spoke passionately about what it \nwould mean to see their histories reflected in the classroom to learn \nabout the struggles, contributions and stories of Asian Americans as \npart of the American narrative.  This bill, the AANHPI Education \nEquity Act, is inspired by them and by so many others across New \nYork who are demanding a more inclusive curriculum. \nAsian Americans have helped build this country, \ngeneration after generation.  But our history has too often been \nignored, marginalized or erased, and now in states across the country, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n287that erasure is being weaponized.  Books are being banned, history is \nbeing censored, and people in power are trying to silence our voices, \nintimidate our communities, and strip our communities of dignity.  \nBut we are still here and we will not be silenced.  \nWe remember Won Kim Ark, who took his case to \nthe Supreme Court to affirm that children born in this country are \ncitizens, regardless of their parents' nationality.  We remember Fred \nKorematsu, who resisted the incarceration of Japanese Americans \nduring World War II, and stood up for justice even when his \ngovernment failed him.  And in this moment when anti-Asian hate is \non the rise and our civil rights are under attack, we cannot let fear or \nrevisionism dictate what our children learn.  Education is one of our \nmost powerful tools against hate.  When we teach truth we build \nunderstanding.  When we reflect all of our histories, we create \nbelonging.  \nThis bill is not just a policy step -- step.  It's a \nstatement that our stories matter.  That our community deserves to be \nrecognized and seen, and that we are not guests in this House, we are \nbuilders of it. \nI will be voting in the affirmative.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Lee in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Gallahan to explain his vote. \nMR. GALLAHAN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nI will be voting in the negative on this bill for the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n288mere fact that there is no representation from the Minority \nConference.  By not having participation from the Minority \nConference in this Committee, we're omitting six million voters, or \nresidents, from the State of New York from representation.  I would \nencourage everyone in this room to support my bill, A.01353, which \nwould require certain bills which establish a commission, task force, \nboard, council or any similar Body will have not less than one position \nappointed by each of the legislative leaders.  That way you won't be \neliminating six million voices from our State in these commissions. \nThank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Gallahan in the \nnegative.\nMr. Tague to explain his vote. \nMR. TAGUE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nI, too, will be voting -- be voting in the negative \nbecause the Minority again has no person on this Commission to be \nable to pick people.  I believe we actually have people within our \nConference that are of Chinese descent.  It's a shame. \nI also was a little taken aback by the sponsor and the \nway she treated our Floor Leader during the debate when just a simple \nquestion was asked. \nFor those reasons and many others, it's a real shame \nbut I'll be voting no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Tague in the \nnegative.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n289Ms. Lunsford to explain her vote. \nMS. LUNSFORD:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I'd \nlove to commend the sponsor.  And it's nice to hear so many people \nconcerned about representing Minority point of views and \nunderstanding that people with different lived experiences can \ncontribute different perspectives.  \nSo this bill is, I think, timely and appropriate to the \nsituation and I vote in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Lunsford in the \naffirmative.\nMr. Meeks to explain his vote. \nMR. MEEKS:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for an \nopportunity to explain my vote.  I want to commend the sponsor on \nthis legislation.  They say if you want your story told, you better tell it \nyourself.  That way you make sure we get it right.  As it relates to the \ndebate on the floor, you know, when you're dealing with lived \nexperience, sometimes emotions may take a hold.  But the goal is to \ndo something for your community.  And not only for your community, \nbut for all of us as the State of New York.  I feel once we have a better \nunderstanding of one another, of our culture, our background, our \nexperience, we do better by one another. \nI'll be voting in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Meeks in the \naffirmative.\nMr. DiPietro to explain his vote. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n290MR.

I'm not sure how we got so far away from the topic here of \ndiscussion, but I do want to commend the sponsor of this legislation.  \nAnd I do think she handled herself in a -- in a very dignified and \ninspiring way in her responses to the questions.  It's hard to understand \nsometimes how people always want to participate in whatever the \ndiscussion is, but when there are discussions going on at other levels \nthat minimize the same people that they want to sit and discuss with, \nthere's silence.  And so at some point it makes sense for her to raise \nthe comments that she raised.  \nAnd so I want to thank her for doing that, and I look \nforward to voting for her legislation. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mrs. Peoples- \nStokes in the affirmative.\nMr. Burdick to explain his vote. \nMR. BURDICK:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nallowing me to explain my vote.   \nThis really is a very simple bill.  It simply authorizes \nthe Commissioner of Education to conduct a survey.  A survey on \ninstruction for Asian American, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Island \n-- Islander history, and to establish an advisory committee.  That's all \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n291it does.  And, you know, it seems just something that we, as New \nYorkers, celebrate our diversity.  We celebrate that as our strength.  \nAnd this is simply furthering our ability to do it with something \nimpactful.  This simply lays the groundwork to make sure that \neducational instruction aligns with the needs of these so often \nmarginalized communities.\nSo I wish to commend the sponsor for her \nperseverance, her tenacity in moving this bill forward, and wish to \nthank the Speaker for bringing it to the floor.  I vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Burdick in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas to explain her vote. \nMS. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-ROJAS:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker. \nI also want to commend the sponsor for her relentless \npursue [sic] for equity and dignity, and elevating the voices of the \nAAPI community.  I represent a district that is nearly 20 percent Asian \nAmerican, Pacific Islander, and their stories are not being told.  And \nit's really critical that we are ensuring that we have an education \nsystem that lifts the experiences of all the communities that represent \nwho we are here in New York.  And we want to make sure that those \nthat are part of that effort have a commitment to ensuring fairness and \nequity in that process. \nSo as a proud member of the APA Task Force and, \nagain, someone who represents a diverse community of the AAPI \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n292community, I'm very, very proud to vote in the affirmative and I hope \nmy colleagues do the same. \nThank you so much. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez- \nRojas in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

An act to amend the Criminal Procedure Law, \nin relation to requiring police officers to take temporary custody of \nfirearms when responding to reports of family violence.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by Ms. \nPaulin, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced. \nAn explanation has been requested.\nMs. Paulin. \nMS. PAULIN:  Thank you so much.  \nThe legislation requires law enforcement to take \ntemporary custody of firearms when responding to a report of family \nviolence when such removal is necessary to protect the victim or other \npersons present. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n293MS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Happy to. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  \nSo this bill was first introduced in 2021, but today \nwill be our first vote on it.  Okay.  So I wanted to say first that \nprotecting victims from gun violence is a laudable legislative \nobjective.  But I want to -- I want to kind of start out by just reviewing \nour current state of the law.  So under the CPL currently, police, when \nresponding to a family offense, can take temporary custody for at least \n48 hours of firearms in plain sight or when discovered via a \nconsensual or other lawful search, but requires police to take \ntemporary custody of firearms when they are in the possession of a \nperson being arrested for a family offense or suspected of committing \na family offense.  Already in the law.  Under current law, if a police \nofficer thinks there is probable cause to believe that a person is at risk \nof harming themselves or others, the officer may apply for a TERPO, \na Temporary Extreme Risk Protection Order, to a State Supreme \nCourt Judge or an acting State Supreme Court Judge.  The judge will \nreview the application on an emergency basis 24/7, and will issue the \nTERPO followed by a due process hearing within a few days to \ndetermine if the TERPO should become an ERPO after clear and \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n294convincing evidence if it's shown. \nWe also have Orders of Protection.  If an Order of \nProtection is issued by a court, then law enforcement will go out \nimmediately to the home and take any firearms from that person. \nAll right.  Big lead up.  So now my first question.  \nWhat does this legislation do that's different than what we already \nhave?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Okay.  So I worked with the -- the \nofficer who trains police on when to take guns out of the home in -- \nwhen they go into a situation of domestic violence. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay. \nMS. PAULIN:  And what he said was that in New \nYork City they use this model that we have in the bill.  When the \nperson -- they use the -- the domestic incident report to establish the \ngrounds under which you would take a gun.  He liked that model, and \nthat's what New York City is training their officers to do.  The rest of \nthe State, as we know, because we don't live in the City, you know, \nhave a variety of police departments and they do a variety of things.  \nAnd he thought that when he's training the police, because the \nlanguage in the law was so vague when, you know, they may take a \ngun, you know, when they see that -- it was just -- it was done very \ndifferently in every single jurisdiction  no matter what kind of training \nhe gave.  So he thought if we codified what was in New York City, \nwhat they were doing in practice, which is working, we won't have \nincidents where guns are left in very dangerous situations. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n295The second part of the bill, of course, is how long \nwe're gonna hold the gun before we give it back.  And his thinking, \nafter being part of this domestic violence guns world after -- for many, \nmany years was that 48 hours was not a long enough cooling off \nperiod and we're giving the guns back.  But the cooling off period \nneeded to be a little longer, and that's the second part of the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  All right.  That's a wonderful \nexplanation.  So that was one of my questions, was going to 120 \nhours, or five days, versus the 48 hours under current law, was there -- \nhow was that number determined?  Just a sense that that -- that five \ndays is an appropriate -- \nMS. PAULIN:  I don't -- I don't think that we did it \nscientifically.  We just -- you know, we just picked a number that was \nlonger than two days and said let's see how this works.  Because we \nknow that, you know, many -- you know, what happens after there's \nbeen a police incident in a domestic violence home, the -- the \nescalation is almost immediate.  You know, the reaction of the abuser \nto the victim is escalated and very problematic.  And so we know that \nthere needs to be a bit of a cooling off period.  And sometimes the -- \nthe abuser is removed from the home, and that could be the entire 48 \nhours worth of time and then they're going back in, potentially, to a \nvery volatile situation.  So we picked 120 days [sic].  You know, if we \nsee that that's too long or too short, we may come back and revisit it.  \nBut it's a bit of -- you know, there's a bit of arbitrariness, I'm -- I'm \ngonna admit. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n296MS. WALSH:  Yeah.  Well, that's fair.  I appreciate -- \nI appreciate you saying that. \nSo the bill authorizes the seizure of a firearm by the \npolice when they believe that doing so would prevent the risk of \nviolence or threat.  Could you provide an example of when that would \nhappen?  I mean, isn't it likely that if someone is threatening violence \nwith a firearm, then that person is likely already committing a crime?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Well, again, we -- we -- I point to the \n-- the domestic violence incident report, and a police officer, when \nthey go into these homes, is required to essentially check off.  And the \ncheckoff that they use is they -- they -- the first thing is is there a \nsuspect of threats, yes or no?  If yes, threats to the victim, threats to \nthe children, threats to the pet, threats to commit suicide, other -- \nother.  And so they have to check that off.  So that's one of the \ncheckoffs that would be used to consider whether or not -- if there's a \nyes, they would take the -- the gun if it was visible, obviously, you \nknow. \nMS. WALSH:  Right. \nMS. PAULIN:  The -- I'm looking for more.  Then, \nyou know, has the suspect ever -- this is questions that they would ask \nthe, you know, the person who was claiming that the other person was \nabusing them -- has the suspect ever threatened to kill you or your \nchildren, yes or no?  Has the suspect ever strangled or choked you, yes \nor no?  Has the suspect ever beaten you while you were pregnant, yes \nor no?  Has the suspect -- is -- do you believe the suspect is capable of \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n297killing you or your children, yes or no?  Is the suspect violently and \nconstantly jealous of you, yes or no?  And has the physical violence \nincreased in frequency or severity over the past six months?  So those \nare the questions that they would ask the victim.  You know, they ask \nnow.  And if there was a yes answer, you know, again, in New York \nCity the gun is removed.  Again, Upstate or outside of the City it's \nerratic.  In some places -- I was talking to a former police officer, \nright, in this Chamber and he was saying that they always remove \nguns in a domestic violence incident because they believe that it could \nbe problematic.  This gives guidance to those police officers that have \nthat hesitation. \nMS. WALSH:  And so is that checkoff form, the one \nthat you mentioned that there was an individual that does training that \nyou were working with in the development of the bill, I mean, is that \n-- is that what New York City does now, that form?  But is that \nstandardized throughout the State?  \nMS. PAULIN:  This form is standardized through the \nentire State. \nMS. WALSH:  It is.\nMS. PAULIN:  DCJS is responsible for the form.  \nMS. WALSH:  Okay. \nMS. PAULIN:  And the difference is that, you know, \nin New York City the guidance that they tell the officers, if they check \noff yes, take the gun.  Where they don't -- also in New York City is, \nyou know, one police department.  It's a little easier to have a uniform \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n298policy. \nMS. WALSH:  That's very true. \nMS. PAULIN:  So that's, you know, so -- you know, \nit's the domestic violence advocates in New York City think it's \nworking really, really well, and so that's why we came up with this \nidea. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So there -- there is a long list \nof family offenses, I noticed, which includes something like identity \ntheft is a family offense.  I mean, could it be an alleged crime not \ninvolving violence like identity theft, or are you -- would you redirect \nme back to that form?  \nMS. PAULIN:  I would redirect you back here. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right.  So when police \nrespond to a family offense there's usually an attempt to deescalate the \nsituation.  Is there any concern that there could be an unintended \nconsequence of worsening the environment or heighten stress and \nupset when -- when the firearms are being taken?  \nMS. PAULIN:  So, I mean, I'm -- I'm not a police \nofficer and I've never been in these situations personally, so I -- that's \na little hard for me to answer.  But I know that police officers do \nbelieve that when they take a gun away, it may not deescalate it, but it \nprevents potential use of that weapon. \nMS. WALSH:  Well, right. \nMS. PAULIN:  So, you know, I think that the statistic \nis something like 500 percent.  There's a 500 percent chance of killing \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n299the victim if there's a firearm present in the home when there's \ndomestic violence. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, I -- I understand what you're \nsaying.  I just -- what I was asking was kind of like by the -- by the \ntaking of the firearm, could there be an un -- unintended consequence \nof actually heightening the -- or escalating the risk of harm?  It might \nnot be lethal force, it might not, you know -- but there's a lot of ways \nto hurt somebody.  Was that -- was that factored in or was the goal just \nsimply get the firearms out?  That's the goal and that's -- \nMS. PAULIN:  So, if you have a situation where you \nhave two people who are -- one who is victimizing the other one and \nthe police officer comes in, no matter whether they take the gun or not \nthere's gonna be an escalation because that police officer was there.\nMS. WALSH:  Right.  Okay.\nMS. PAULIN:  So it's much better to remove the gun \nbecause you don't want the escalation to include using the gun. \nMS. WALSH:  I had -- I had a couple of \nhypotheticals that I came up with, and I just wanted to throw them out \nand just get your -- get your take on it.  So, a man owns a house, and \nin that house he has multiple firearms and a license to carry them.  \nThe man's son and girlfriend are living temporarily in the house, and \nthey get into a huge fight.  The police are called.  Under this \nlegislation, are police required to take the homeowner's firearms and \nlicense?  Even though he wasn't part of that fight and he didn't do \nanything wrong. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n300MS. PAULIN:  That -- that's a very interesting \nhypothetical.  I -- I think if -- if the victim said I feel that kind of threat \nand those guns were in an obvious place, I -- you know, because you \ncan't search without a warrant, then yeah, I think that the guns would \nhave to be removed.  But that's -- you know, but it -- maybe that \nwould need to be tested in court, I'm not sure.  But -- but I do think \nunder that scenario, yes, you would have to remove the gun. \nMS. WALSH:  So what I was curious about -- \nMS. PAULIN:  I have an answer here. \nMS. WALSH:  Oh, you've got -- you've got -- you're \nconferring.  Okay.  Very good. \n(Conferencing)\nMS. PAULIN:  So what they're saying is -- and again, \nthis is the vagueness -- if it's in their possession, you know, but I don't \n-- you know, but I -- I don't know what possession means, because is it \nownership or not?  So I guess if they were able to get to the gun.  You \nknow, if it was locked up -- or, you know, our last -- our last debate -- \nand they didn't have a key and they couldn't get access, then probably \nthey wouldn't have to take the gun.  That would be my take on it.  But \nif they had a key and they could get possession of the gun, then they \nwould. \nMS. WALSH:  So I -- and I was curious to know your \nanswer to that because I was thinking that -- that that could potentially \nbe an unconstitutional seizure, violating the U.S. and New York State \nConstitutions because the legislation doesn't just limit it to the bad \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n301actor's firearms.  You know, that -- that's why I was asking the \nquestion, and -- and it kind of --  \nMS. PAULIN:  But remember, it's still only \ntemporary. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah. \nMS. PAULIN:  You know, so they do get it back.  \nAnd it's only -- you know, and I feel very confident in this answer now \n-- it's only if the abuser would have an ability to get to the gun.  So if it \nwas -- if the owner locked it up, you know, and the abuser didn't have \nthat access, then they wouldn't take it. \nMS. WALSH:  So even though the -- the wording of \nthe bill changes it from \"may\" to \"shall\" so it becomes more of a \ndirection to the law enforcement, the responding officer to do that. \nMS. PAULIN:  (Indiscernible/cross-talk).  Under \nvery limited circumstances. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right. \nSecond hypothetical, and I think it's the last one.  \nMan is driving in his car with his adult son and son's wife.  The son \nstarts beating up the wife in the back seat of the car.  The car is pulled \nover for speeding and swerving.  Officer sees marks on the wife and \nthe wife confirms domestic violence.  Is the officer required to take \nthe driver's firearm which is in the vehicle safely secured?  \nMS. PAULIN:  I think it's very similar.  You know, if \nthe -- if -- if the gun was locked and the -- the person who was beating \nup the wife didn't have the key, then it's not in their -- it's not in their \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n302possession, it's in the other guy's possession. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  I see the distinction that you're \ndrawing.  That -- that makes me feel a bit better.  Okay.  \nIn the Memorandum of Support it says that the \nNYPD Public Patrol Guide and New York State Unified Court \nSystem's 2020 protocols already mandate, rather than permit, firearm \nseizure.  So if that's already in these guidelines, why do we need to \nlegislate this?  And you're saying -- I think you already addressed this \nbecause you said that it's being inconsistently applied throughout the \nState and you wanted to have a more uniform standard; is that -- is \nthat right?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Yes. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Okay.  I think that you've \nanswered those questions for me, and I think at this point I'll just go \non the bill.  Thank you very much. \nMS. PAULIN:  Thank you.  Okay. \nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  And I will continue to go on the bill.  \nThank you.\nSo, I believe that in a true domestic violence \nsituation, safety is illusory.  I think that police can remove firearms, \nbut knives, hammers, other sharp objects, fists, steel-toed boots \nremain, just as TERPOs have become a huge cover-your-behind \nexercise in many parts of the State for our law enforcement.  I could \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n303see this becoming the same. \nTo prevent risk of further violence or threat is \nextremely broad.  It may look like we're giving law enforcement \ndiscretion here to decide, but really, they are going to err on the side \nof removing all firearms from the bad actor, and potentially firearms \nowned by others in the house who had nothing whatsoever to do with \nthe domestic violence.  I do have concerns about the constitutionality \nof that, although I do appreciate the sponsor's answer on that. \nI want to just, I guess, close with -- with a thought.  \nWhen we were talking, the sponsor and I were talking about the idea \nof providing a cooling off period.  It just made me think of the -- the \nbail so-called \"reform laws\" that were passed a couple of years ago \nand all of the concerns that were raised by advocates in the -- that \nwork with domestic violence survivors who are -- were really \nconcerned that you could do an arrest of an individual and then you're \n-- you're just processing them and putting them right back out there \nagain.  And I just think that instead of fixing something like bail \nreform which lets these individuals out right after processing, we're \ndoing something like this bill.  And I -- I don't think it's -- I -- I \nappreciate what the sponsor is telling me about this bill, but it has \nquite a bit of opposition because of the things that we've discussed.  \nAnd I do think that there are a lot of other things that we could do that \nwould truly support domestic violence survivors and all the people \nthat do remarkable work with them.  \nSo a number of us may be in the negative on this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n304particular bill.  But I do thank the sponsor for her responses to my \nquestions.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield? \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMS. PAULIN:  Sure. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. MOLITOR:  I'm behind you to the right.  \nMS. PAULIN:  Yes.\nMR. MOLITOR:  You do not have to turn around, \nthough.  \nMS. PAULIN:  That's okay. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  So I just want to focus on \nthe \"shall\" section.  So in the event that there's a domestic violence \nsituation and someone's arrested for a family offense, the police shall \ntake temporary custody of the enumerated weapons in this section, \nright?  And -- but they can only do so where those certain sections are \nmarked off in the DIR, right, or if there's a reasonable belief that it is \nnecessary to protect the victim -- I'm shortening this a little bit -- or to \nprevent risk of further violence or threats. \nMS. PAULIN:  Right.  Well, the -- the \"may\" part, \nyou know, that second part that you were talking about is already the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n305law. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Right. \nMS. PAULIN:  So, yes, the \"shall\" part is the part \nwe're adding, which is the checkoff, as you said. \nMR. MOLITOR:  And the -- and the \"shall\" is in \nthose -- those two -- really two circumstances; the one where the \nvictim marks off the certain sections of the DIR, or there's a \nreasonable belief from the officer that there's a violent situation, right?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Mm-hmm. \nMR. MOLITOR:  I'm -- I'm, you know, shortening \nthat a little bit.  \nBut now I just want to focus on the -- the timeline a \nlittle.  So the DIR, the domestic incident report, I've seen many of \nthose, probably thousands of those.  When are those DIRs actually \ncompleted?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Well, those questions are asked on \nthe spot, you know, when they fill out the form later, I don't know.  \nBut the questions in the DIR are asked on the spot. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  So I'm sure, as you know, \nnot every domestic violence situation is immediately reported.  So \nwhat about those circumstances where a victim is finally able to get \naway from their abuser and they come to the police station to fill out a \nDIR.  In that circumstance, what if -- what if -- I want to give you a \nvery specific scenario -- what if that happens and we're, like, three \ndays after the incident?  What are the police supposed to do in that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n306situation?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Well, the police wouldn't be present \nin the home, right --   \nMR. MOLITOR:  Right. \nMS. PAULIN:  -- in that situation.  So they don't see \nthe gun, it's not before them.  They can't take it away. \nMR. MOLITOR:  But this -- but this legislation \ndoesn't require them to see the gun, does it?  \nMS. PAULIN:  The gun has to be in their -- you \nknow, yes, they have to either see the gun or if -- because they can't \nsearch a home without permission from the parties. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Right. \nMS. PAULIN:  So if, for example, you know, I -- I \nwould presume, let's --  let's just take the -- the example where they \ncould take a gun potentially.  If they fill out the domestic violence \nincident report and there were all these threats and, you know, He's \ngonna kill me and this and that, and the question is asked and there are \nguns in the house, you know, the police officer could say to the \nvictim, you know, Can I search?  And if she's the only one present, \nthen I guess he could.  But I don't know that, you know, this really \nallows them to go back into the home if they're not there.  So I would \n-- I would say that that's never gonna happen.  You know, the \nlikelihood is that they would seek a warrant to search the premises if \nthey think that there's real danger. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Or get a TERPO --   \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n307MS. PAULIN:  Yeah. \nMR. MOLITOR:  -- in that sort of situation.  Okay.  \nWhat about the situation where the police are on the scene and they're \nasking these questions of the victim, the victim's giving them the \nanswers that allow them to conduct the search, but the victim is not --    \ndoes not have any lawful authority to consent to a search, and --  \nMS. PAULIN:  What -- what do you mean?  \nMR. MOLITOR:  Well, let's say that the victim didn't \nlive at that location, right?  Let's say -- let's say a boyfriend and \ngirlfriend, the girlfriend just happens to be there for dinner, there's a \ndomestic violence situation.  The police are called, and the victim has, \nyou know, answered the questions that give rise --  \nMS. PAULIN:  Well, I think you've answered it.  If \nthe -- if the victim doesn't have the lawful ability to agree to a search \nthen the police officer can't search. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  So this is -- this is really \nonly constrained to those situations where the victim has -- has lawful \nauthority to consent to a search, or the police see one of the \nenumerated weapons in plain view. \nMS. PAULIN:  I mean, if both are present and the \nabuser says you can't search, they can't search.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Right.\nMS. PAULIN:  Right?  They can only search if the \nvictim's there without the abuser and they have lawful ability to say, \nYou can search this house . \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n308MR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  Thank you very much for \nclarifying that. \nNow, when the police do seize these weapons -- and \nlet's just use a handgun as an example -- where are the police \nsupposed to store these guns for the temporary period of time?  I think \nit's 120 hours, right?  \nMS. PAULIN:  I -- I believe they all have places \nwhere they store weapons now, and this would just be added to that \narsenal of weapons. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  So in my district there's -- I \nhave a lot of small police departments, much smaller than NYPD, and \nthey have --  \nMS. PAULIN:  Me, too. \nMR. MOLITOR:  -- very, very limited storage space \nfor their -- their evidence rooms.  \nMS. PAULIN:  Hopefully they have limited domestic \nviolence incidents as well.\nMR. MOLITOR:  I -- I know that not to be true.  \nThere's a lot of domestic violence, unfortunately.  So, you know, as \nyou can imagine, because there a lot of domestic violence there could \nend up being a lot of these weapon seized for a five-day period, which \ncould be very overwhelmingly for evidence officers.  Is there -- you \nknow, but there's no requirement under the law that they secure them \nin an evidence room, right?  They could have some other place to \nsecure them as long as they're secured. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n309MS. PAULIN:  I think that there are police protocols \nthat they have to use to store those weapons.  That would be the same \nfor this. \nMR. MOLITOR:  And I'll -- I'll defer to my police \nofficer friends on that question as well. \nNow, what about the -- the processing of those \nweapons?  In -- in my -- in my district, if the police seize a handgun, \nfor example, they're gonna do ballistics testing on it.  They're gonna \ndo -- probably they might do DNA testing on it.  They might do \nfingerprint analysis.  And the reason why they do that, specifically \nballistics testing, is they enter that into a Statewide database and they \nmight find that that gun was used in another -- in another crime \nsomewhere in the State.  Would this law prevent them from doing that \nsort of testing on the weapon?  \nMS. PAULIN:  Whatever the law currently is when \nweapons are in their possession would be the same for this.  We don't \nspeak to the -- we don't differentiate this between, you know, among \nall of the other reasons that they might have a gun in their possession. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay. \nAnd my last question, I guess, you know, I \nunderstand exactly why this particular piece of legislation is being \nbrought forth -- brought forth.  And sort of piggybacking off -- off the \nFloor Leader here, why -- why limit it to just these enumerated \nweapons?  Why not expand it to the Penal Law definition of illegal \nweapons and dangerous instruments?  And then that way if the police \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n310are in -- you know, they respond to a scene and the victim is not -- you \nknow, the abuser doesn't have guns, that's not the issue.  Maybe it is a \nhammer or a knife or a leather belt or whatever it might be, the police \ncould seize those things as well.  Why limit it in this particular \n(indiscernible/cross-talk).  \nMS. PAULIN:  You're giving me an idea, but I didn't \nthink of it for this -- for this bill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  Thank you very much for \nyour questions.  I appreciate it. \nMS. PAULIN:  Thank you. \nMR.

ANGELINO:  To explain my vote.  My concern \nwith this is we spend a lot of time talking about the seizing and the \ntaking and the storing, but nobody mentioned the giving back.  So at \nsome point there's two things that concern me; somebody's gonna \ncome to the police station after 100-and whatever it is hours, and a \npolice officer is gonna have to give them back their firearm.  He's \nalready upset, or she.  And, Here's your -- here's your firearm.  \nThe next thing that concerns me is there's nothing in \nthere that protects the police officer who seized it.  Because the last \nperson who handed that gun to a pissed-off man who's gonna go back \nhome is the police officer.  And these police officers are going to be \nscrutinized, Why did you give it back?  You knew what he was gonna \ndo.  And I just don't like the idea of -- of \"shall\" seize anybody's \nproperty in the law when the Constitution has an amendment that \nspecifically says you can't. \nSo I'll be voting no. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Angelino in the \nnegative.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n312Ms. Griffin to explain her vote. \nMS. GRIFFIN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nallowing me to explain my vote.  I appreciate the Assemblymember \nfor carrying this important legislation. \nIt is well-documented that domestic calls by police \npresent a high risk to all at the scene.  In the aftermath of a police \nresponse it has been proven that the danger drastically escalates.  So \nhaving the police take temporary possession of firearms is key.  It is \nclear that this measure will save lives, that is why I've cosponsored \nthis legislation and vote in the affirmative. \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Griffin in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

An act to \namend the Environment Conservation Law, in relation to prohibiting \nthe lease of state forests, reforestation areas, wildlife management \nareas and unique areas for gas and oil production.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On a motion by \nMs. Glick, the Senate bill is before the House.  The Senate bill is \nadvanced.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n313An explanation has been requested.\nMs. Glick. \nMS. GLICK:  Thank you very much.  The purpose of \nthis bill is rather modest.  It seeks to protect certain lands from oil and \ngas production, leasing.  Currently, we prohibit the exploration and \ndevelopment of oil and gas leases on -- in state parks and the lands \nunder the waters of Lake Ontario and along the shoreline.  This would \nsimply add to that; state-owned state forests, reforestation areas, \nwildlife management areas and unique areas.  And the unique areas \nare defined as lands of special natural beauty, wilderness character, \ngeological, ecological, or historical significance.  And that is all it \ndoes.  A -- protecting those additional types of land for which we have \nspecial needs, to preserve our forests, wilderness areas, so that the \nnatural areas and the wildlife resources of the state are protected and \nthese unique areas and reforestation areas that we have spent time and \nenergy ensuring are, in fact, reforested. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Simpson.\nMR.

SIMPSON:  I just have a few questions.  In the \nsummary -- in the -- your explanation, you talked about the additional \nareas that are included in this bill that aren't already covered and you \nmention wildlife management areas.  Could you explain what a \nwildlife management area is?  \nMS. GLICK:  Yes.  The wildlife management areas \nare lands that are owned by the State and are under the control of \nDEC; specifically, their division of fish, wildlife and marine \nresources.  And they have been specifically acquired and maintained \nby DEC, primarily for the production and use of wildlife, which are \nthe natural resources of the -- of the State and would be incompatible \nand would be very disruptive to maintaining wildlife if there were \nthese other activities. \nMR. SIMPSON:  Is that the same as the wildlife \nmanagement units that New York State DEC has that encompasses \nevery bit of New York State?  \nMS. GLICK:  No.  These are specific and you'll see \nsigns, \"wildlife -- \nMR. SIMPSON:  Okay.\nMS. GLICK:  -- management area\", like --\nMR. SIMPSON:  All right.  Thanks for the -- \nMS. GLICK:  -- Bear Spring, which, I suspect, if \nMr. Angelino was here, he would know.  It's a very specific and \nrelatively contained area. \nMR. SIMPSON:  All right.  Well, thank you for that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n315clarification.  I also want to ask you about -- there -- there are existing \nwells, gas wells, gas operations, in New York State, on state land, \nright now. \nMS. GLICK:  This is perspective. \nMR. SIMPSON:  Right, but there -- but, I am correct \nin saying that there are approximately 100 wells that are still in \noperation in New York State.  \nMS. GLICK:  I don't -- \nMR. SIMPSON:  On state land. \nMS. GLICK:  -- I don't know the exact number, but \nthis wouldn't affect them. \nMR. SIMPSON:  Okay.  So, now we clarified what's \ncovered.  I'm not sure if this is covered in the bill, but does this bill \ninclude language that would prohibit the development of solar or wind \ngeneration facilities, battery storage facilities, or transmission rights?  \nRights-of-way in state and re -- reforestation areas, rather defined \nareas of this bill?  \nMS. GLICK:  No, but that is a good idea. \nMR. SIMPSON:  Well, that's what I was going to ask \nyou, is why not?  \nMS. GLICK:  Well, this bill's been around a little bit \nand we focused on the gas and oil drilling, because that was what \nwas -- at the time that we started with this some years ago, that was \nthe -- the focus.  But, we'll -- we'll think about it. \nMR. SIMPSON:  Yeah.  'Cause it would seem to \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n316conflict with our other goals; you know, the 30 by 30 -- \nwhoops (knocked over mic) -- carbon secret -- sequestration, you \nknow, all of the other -- this seems to conflict by not having that \nincluded in it.  It just kind of seemed odd. \nMS. GLICK:  Well, I -- I hear what you're saying.  \nI -- I think it's probably not the best location for solar, certainly, in the \nforest.  I'm just saying.  But, we'll -- we'll certainly think about that. \nMR. SIMPSON:  No, but it says \"state lands\" and not \nall state lands are just -- \nMS. GLICK:  No.  I understand -- \nMR. SIMPSON:  -- covered in there -- \nMS. GLICK:  -- and we will look -- we will think \nabout that.  \nMR. SIMPSON:  -- and wildlife managements areas \nas well.  Some of those include, I assume, large open fields.  \nGrasslands. \nMS. GLICK:  That -- that's currently not part of the \nbill and the bill before the House is focused on oil and gas, but we will \ntake that under consideration for future legislation. \nMR.

WALSH:  Thank you so much.  I do have a few \nquestions just to get at the scope -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Sure.\nMS. WALSH:  -- of -- of what kinds of temporary \norders that we're talking about and what courts we're talking about.  \nSo, does this -- this legislation look to -- think about orders of \nprotection that are issuing from local courts, is that correct?\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Yes.  It does include local courts, \nbut it does not include family court.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So what I -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  But local criminal courts. \nMS. WALSH:  Local criminal courts.  Yes -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Yes.\nMS. WALSH:  That's the way I read it as well.  Okay.  \nAnd then there are different kinds of orders of protection.  So, you've \ngot full stay-away orders of protection.  You've got refrain from and \nyou see that a lot of times in -- well, you see it -- I've seen them at a \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n322family court, but the idea is that you are being ordered -- you're being \nordered not to commit any offense against the other person and that's \nwhat the order is.  That's the refraining from.  And I know that I've \nseen like orders of protection where they have carveouts for like \ntransferring kids back and forth, or doing visits.  Things like that.  So, \nwhat kinds of orders of protection does this particular bill cover?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  So, this bill actually just establishes \nthe parameters for the evidentiary hearing, which would allow the \njudge to take in more information before issuing an order.  A judge's \nability to issue all of those types of orders remains completely \nunchanged.  They can do limited orders, they can do refrain from \norders.  The gambit of orders remains the same.  This is just \nstandardizing the process for those hearings across the State.  \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So, the -- but the evidenti -- \nevidentiary -- it's getting to be a long night -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Sure.\nMS. WALSH:  -- hearing process could be used, then, \nand utilized for any of these types of orders of protection that we've \ntalked about?  It's not limited to, for example, a full stay-away order of \nprotection -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Correct.\nMS. WALSH:  -- correct?\nMS. SEPTIMO:  The judge, again, would be taking \nin the information and decide to issue whatever order they think is \nappropriate.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n323MS. WALSH:  Okay.  And, you know, it's interesting, \nI -- I was reading that Crawford decision; Matter of Crawford v. Ally, \nfrom 2001 [sic] -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  '21.\nMS. WALSH:  '21, rather.  Yup, '21.  Like I said, it's \ngetting late.  Where -- where there had been a full stay-away order of \nprotection and apparently there was a delay in actually getting a \nreview of whether that temporary order of protection ought to be \nturned into a permanent order of protection.  And in that interim, \nthe -- the -- the woman was completely, like, barred from her house, \nright?  And she had -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  She lost her kids -- \nMS. WALSH:  -- lost her kids -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  She lost her apartment.  \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  And so, like, when you -- \nwhen you were talking at the beginning -- or when you explained the \nbill at the beginning, you talked about the -- you know, the enormous \nhardships that can really fall upon individuals who are -- had these \ntemporary orders of protection that are so complete, that it just really \nturns their life upside down.  And I can -- I can really relate to that.  I \nran into -- a few years ago, before -- actually, before that Crawford \ndecision was -- came down and I was speaking with one of our local -- \nthe local attorneys that I've -- I've known for years, who does a lot of \nwork in local courts and surrogate courts and family court.  And she \nsaid, I have a bill idea for you and it was along these lines.  She had -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n324she had a client who was -- had a full stay-away order of protection \nfrom a girlfriend that he was cohabiting with -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. WALSH:  -- and so he got kicked out of his own \nhouse --   \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. WALSH:  -- and then, in the interim, before his \nmatter could be heard, she trashed the whole house.  She wrecked it \nand then he finally got an ability to go back in the house and she was \nrightly, you know -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Sure.\nMS. WALSH:  -- evicted.  But -- because it wasn't \nher place to begin with, but the damage was done.  I mean, a lot of \ndamage was done.  So, I can completely appreciate, under that kind of \nCrawford theory, with a full stay-away order of protection, that you \nwant to have those handled within, you know, a very short time frame \nand get a final decision.  But do you have any concern with the fact \nthat the scope of this evidentiary hearing requirement would cover \nthings as simple as a refrain from order of protection?  And those are \nroutinely issued, there's a lot of them floating around.  Do you have \nconcerns about, like, clogging, or overwhelming the court system, to \nhandle those?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  We don't because this hearing can \nbe requested by the defendant.  And in those situations, presumably, if \nit's not so disruptive, if people are agreeing that this is a minor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n325adjustment, then maybe it's the case that they waive the decision to \nhave the hearing.  But, this is really, again, for those instances where \nthere is going to be a meaningful disruption and it's not only for the \nfolks who are accused, but it's also for the parties who are seeking to \nbe protected by the orders.  Example, let's say that you have a \ngrandmother who lives with a grandson who's 16 -- let's make him 18 \njust for the sake of clarity.\nMS. WALSH:  Mm-hmm.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  He's 18, things get a little out of \nhand, he calls the cops, they're in court.  Grandma says, I want him to \nbe able to come back home.   There is no formal space for the \ngrandmother to make that known on the record before the court right \nnow.  This bill would make it so that every member, if they're -- every \nparty to the case, if they're wanting to be heard, could do that.  So it's \nreally creating a space for victims, for the accused and for everyone in \nbetween. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah, and -- and I agree with that \nexample.  That's a -- that's another great example of why we would \nwant to have this evidentiary hearing.  I'm thinking about -- you know, \nyou talk about the great disruption that can be caused from orders of \nprotection.  But if it's a -- a simple refrain from order of protection, \nyou go on.  You live your life.  You carry on, you go to work, you live \nyour life; just don't commit any offense against that individual.  Just \nstay out of their way, you know?  Don't -- don't harass them.  Don't \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n326annoy them.  Don't make calls when you're not supposed to.  Don't go \naround the house.  Don't break into their house.  Don't do those things \nand you can just go on and live your life.  And maybe you don't need \nto get a hearing within five days because, really, all we're asking you \nto do is to not commit an offense against that person.  So -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Sure, but if I -- if I may, I think -- \nMS. WALSH:  Sure.  Yeah.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  -- the -- the point of this is that, the \nnature of a temporary order of protection, however limited, is that \nyou're limiting someone's liberty, someone's due process, right?  And \nit requires -- \n(Cross-talk)\nMS. WALSH:  Your liberty to offend against a \nperson -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Your liberty -- \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Period.  \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah. \nMS. SEPTIMO:  And -- and I think we're interested \nin a justice system that recognizes that there needs to be balance and \nthere needs to be due process at every step, irrespective of how small \nor insignificant it might seem to me, or to you, I think to the person \nhaving the opportunity.  And, again, if it's insignificant and they deem \nit so, then they won't have the hearing.  But this is codifying it to that \nthey can if they need it.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n327MS. WALSH:  Well, it's -- you -- you will get the \nhearing if there's a request for a hearing.  And you will -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Correct.\nMS. WALSH:  -- get it fast -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Correct.  \nMS. WALSH:  -- right?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  But if you're -- if you decide that \nyou don't need it, then you won't have it. \nMS. WALSH:  Right.  Well, what about if you're \nrepresented by an attorney and that attorney thinks that there might be \nsome tactical, or strategic, advantage to -- to bringing an application \nlike that?  You're going to -- you make that request, you're going to \nget that hearing, right?\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Certainly, and I think that the -- the \nstrategic, tactical advantage to making sure your due process is \nprotected, sounds like a good attorney. \nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.  I could just see -- I could just \nsee how it could be misused.  But -- I mean, let's move on because \nthere's one more piece I'd really like to hit and that has to do with -- \nthere's -- there's a De Novo review process in the bill that deals with \nbail applications.  Can you talk about that specifically?  What that \ndoes?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  It -- it actually makes it so that the \nDistrict Attorney would have to be also consulted before any of those \nchanges could be made. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n328MS. WALSH:  Okay.  And again, some concern has \nbeen raised that the ability to get a -- a fast De Novo review of the bail \napplication could also have an unintended consequence over \nburdening courts.  But, I -- I suspect that you -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  We -- I -- I -- I hear you raising that \nconcern.\nMS. WALSH:  Yeah.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  We have more than 20 letters of \nsupport.  We have not received one memo of opposition on this bill \nand it's been around since before the Crawford case, actually.  Since \nabout 2019.  So I assume that if there was apprehension coming from \nthe courts, that we would have heard it by now and in fact, there are \nseveral judges on record, in their decision, asking for codified \nguidance around this hearing. \nMS. WALSH:  That's so interesting.  So, it's like, that \nyou got all that -- all those letters of support and yet the bill's been \nkicking around since 2021.  It hadn't been done until now.  So \ntonight will -- tonight will be the first vote on that bill.  So -- or this \nbill.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  And we're looking forward to it.\nMS. WALSH:  We're almost there.  We're almost \nthere.  I think at this point I would like to thank you for answering -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Sure.\nMS. WALSH:  -- my questions and just briefly go on \nthe bill.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n329ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  So I think that the concept -- as I \nmentioned, I had that one experience talking to another practitioner, I \nthink that when there is a full stay-away order of protection, I think \nthat there needs to be an evidentiary hearing and fast because, I think \nthat whether you are losing contact with your kids, you're kicked out \nof your house, possibly there's being damage done to your house while \nyou've been barred from it because somebody else is living there.  We \ncan all think of examples where when there's a full stay-away order -- \nor a full stay-away order of protection, I -- I totally agree that this \nevident -- evidentiary hearing -- I still am having trouble saying it -- is \na good idea.  Where I think I have some reservations, which I tried to \nbring up with the sponsor, is when you've got something that is a little \nbit more simple, true to the people involved it doesn't feel \ninsignificant, or it's substantial and I respect that, but I think that \nsomething like a simple -- simpler refrain from order of protection, \nthose are routinely issued.  Certainly, in family court where, I \nprimarily practice, but in other courts as well.  Local criminal courts \nissue them with a lot of frequency.  If you're allowing a -- an \nevidentiary hearing within five days of just simply upon the request of \nthe -- the defendant, or the party, or if you just want a De Novo review \nprocess of a bail application, I could see there being a significant \nuptick in -- of these -- a -- in burden upon the court system and we're \ntalking about local courts.  We're not talking about -- in -- in the areas \nthat we all represent are various and -- and there's -- there's a lot of -- \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n330there's an amazing quality of the fact that we all represent around the \nsame number of people, but we all represent very different areas of the \nState.  But I can tell you, speaking as an Upstate member, that our \nlocal criminal courts are -- are already pretty overwhelmed and you're \ngonna maybe put that on top of it.  It's to something consider.  I would \nfeel more comfortable if the bill was amended so it really just \naddressed these full stay-aways and -- TOPs and do those.  Have \nthose -- have an evidentiary proceeding for those, within a quick \nperiod of time and maybe leave the refrain froms [sic] away and the -- \nand take the bail applications out them for right now.  \nBut, anyway, I appreciate the -- the sponsor's answers \nto my questions.  I will be in the negative on this bill because I do \nthink that the scope is little bit broader than I'd like, but others may \nfeel differently.  So, thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Sure.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  -- yield?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Yes.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you.  So if a local criminal \ncourt issues an order of protection and the defendant in the case \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n331requests a hearing, that local criminal court must, under this piece of \nlegislation, must have that hearing within five days of that request; is \nthat correct?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Five business days. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Five business days.  Okay.  And -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  I think that's an important \ndistinction.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  And I -- I'm sure as you're \naware, in many of our -- many of our communities across Upstate, we \nhave lots of town and village courts.  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. MOLITOR:  And some of those town and \nvillage courts, especially in rural communities, they only meet once a \nmonth.  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. MOLITOR:  So, in those particular courts, \nsomething like this, which would require them to meet and have \nadditional court appearances, that -- that could create an additional \ncost burden; wouldn't it not?\nMS. SEPTIMO:  We -- in theory, certainly.  But, the \ncourts can schedule these hearings as needed.  So, we hope that they \nwill do everything they can to comply. \nMR. MOLITOR:  But -- but they don't really have \ndiscretion, right?  Like if a defendant says, I want this hearing , they \nhave to do it within five business days.  There's no exceptions.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n332(Conferencing)\nMS. SEPTIMO:  So the -- if you go to -- this is online \n-- if you go to line 39, you will see that -- I don't know if you have the \nbill in front of you.  I'm sorry to assume that.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  I do.  I do, yeah.  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Okay.  Great.  If you go to line 39, \nyou'll see that the -- if the local court denies the request, then the \nsuperior court actually will have the hearing.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  I'm sorry.  I couldn't hear you.  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  If the local court denies the request \nfor the hearing, then a superior court will have the hearing in its place. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  So if -- so a local court \ncould say, we're not going to do the hearing  and the superior court \nwill then have to do it -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Correct.\nMR. MOLITOR:  Would the -- would the superior \ncourt have to do it within that five days as well?\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Yes. \nMR. MOLITOR:  All right.  So what if you have a \nsituation and this is a real situation, because this would happen in my \ncounty, where you might have only one superior court judge available \nand that superior court judge is in the middle of a trial and they're \nunable to do it, what would happen in that situation?\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Again, I think this is where the \ncourts would have to work to schedule these hearings as needed, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n333because it would be the law and they'd have to sort of facilitate.  You \nnow, in your example, have a local court denying it and now a \nsuperior court issue.  We would hope that between two levels of court, \nthere's an effort to comply.\nMR. MOLITOR:  But -- but it's possible that the \nsuperior court might not be available to take the hearing and then \nwe're stuck.\n(Conferencing)\nMS. SEPTIMO:  The court, certainly, assuming that \nyou have been at a trial before, the court can certainly make the effort \nto schedule a hearing despite the fact that it's having a trial, because \nthe court manages its own schedule. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  Now, what happens if the \ncase -- this -- this hearing can only be requested when the matter is \npending in local criminal court, right?\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Correct.\nMR. MOLITOR:  So what happens when the case is \nsort of in limbo?  And let me give you -- \nMS. SEPTIMO:  You'll have to be more specific --\n(Cross-talk)\nMR. MOLITOR:  -- let me give you -- I'll give you an \nexample.  On a felony, the case first starts in local criminal court --  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. MOLITOR:  And there is -- there can be a \npreliminary hearing.  If that preliminary hearing is waived, or the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n334hearing is run, then the case is held for action by a grand jury.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Mm-hmm.\nMR. MOLITOR:  If a defendant in that circumstance \nrequests a hearing, under this legislation, they would not be entitled to \none; am I correct?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Under that circumstance, the \nquestion that I answered before --\nMR. MOLITOR:  Sorry.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  -- for our other colleague, under that \ncircumstance the District Attorney would also have to agree to the \nhearing. \nMR. MOLITOR:  I'm sorry for re-asking that \nquestion.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  That's okay.\nMR. MOLITOR:  I must have been out of the room.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  That's okay.  Welcome back. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Do you anticipate there being a lot \nof these hearings? \nMS. SEPTIMO:  I couldn't -- I'm not a fortune teller \nand I won't pretend to be. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  \nWould you agree with me that this legislation makes \nit easier for defendants to sort of get, like, an initial crack at a case or \nmaybe to revictimize domestic violence survivors, as we're calling \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n335them (indiscernible/cross-talk). \nMS. SEPTIMO:  I do not.  And I've mentioned that \nthere were several Memos of Support; one of those organizations that \nhad written a Memo of Support is actually the New York State \nCoalition Against Sexual Assault, and there are other victims groups \nas well.  Again, this is establishing the guidelines for an evidentiary \nhearing where both the accused and the victims have an opportunity to \npresent evidence on why an order should be issued, the scope of the \norder, et cetera. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So I'm sure you remember earlier \ntoday, I think it was today, we had a bill about nurses in particular or \nhospital staff maybe not feeling safe in giving a statement back at the \npolice station and feeling like they're revictimized because of that. \nMS. SEPTIMO:  I'm sorry, I -- I may not have been \nhere for that, but I'd love to talk to you about this bill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  The reason I bring that up is \nbecause by -- by codifying this evidentiary hearing, we're -- you know, \nthe court has already done an initial analysis.  They've determined that \nan Order of Protection is necessary.  They've issued an Order of \nProtection.  And then the defendant, say the defendant in a domestic \nviolence situation could say,  I disagree.  I want the victim to testify.  \nSo I'm gonna request a hearing in the hopes that the victim will have \nto testify. \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Well, in this bill, actually, there is \nhearsay evidence.  Hearsay evidence is admissible as long as it's done \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n336through a witness.  So a police officer who is responding on the scene \ncould be the person who comes to testify.  There is no requirement for \nvictims to appear at any point in this hearing if they don't want to. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So how does this actually protect \nsomebody who has an Order of Protection against them and has been \nlocked out of their property?  If, for example, I, as a prosecutor, can \njust put a police officer on the stand to read what the victim has \nalready said about the case. \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Again, as I told your colleague a \nfew minutes ago, this would make it so that the judge would have an \nopportunity to receive evidence from all parties.  And so that would \ngive the defendant also an opportunity to share any evidence that's \nrelevant.  In the case of Miss Crawford, which is the court case that \nled to the decision which is leading to hopefully us codifying this now, \nMiss Crawford didn't have an opportunity to share the details that \nwould have been relevant for the judge to know.  It rendered her \nhomeless, it separated her from her kids for three months.  On the \nother side, the order was ultimately dismissed.  If there were more \ninformation on the front end, one could anticipate that the judge \nwould have decided differently, but there just was not a venue.  This is \ncreating a venue for information to make its way into the court. \nMR. MOLITOR:  But isn't that the defendant -- the \ndefendant's attorney's job at arraignment to be sharing all that \ninformation with the judge so that Orders of Protection aren't issued, \nyou know, irresponsibly?  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n337MS. SEPTIMO:  This is standardizing that process to \ngive judges the space to make those decisions with a venue to enter \nevidence.  Right now it doesn't exist. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So why not require that at \narraignment instead of five days after the process?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Well, just a moment ago you \nmentioned wanting to give the opportunity for these hearings to \nhappen in a way that was not burdensome and that would give folks \nthe opportunity to get the evidence that they needed.  If you are to \nhave a police officer testifying, it might be difficult to have them there \nfor every arraignment. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Yeah, but it's -- we're just talking \nabout hearsay evidence anyway, right?  \nMS. SEPTIMO:  But it needs to be presented through \na live witness.  If you have the bill in front of you, you'll see that. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Which could be anybody.\nMS. SEPTIMO:  Someone who presumably is \nconnected to the case, like a police officer. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Does it say that in this legislation?  \nI thought the exception in the legislation was just it could be presented \n-- hearsay could be presented as long as it was through a live witness. \nMS. SEPTIMO:  Correct. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So it could be anybody. \nMS. SEPTIMO:  In theory. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n338On the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So as a former defense lawyer -- \nI'm gonna put my defense lawyer hat on -- I'm requesting this hearing \nin every case in which an Order of Protection was issued.  I'm doing it \nso that I can gain a strategic advantage over the case, try to get any \npiece of evidence that I want -- that I'm hoping to receive at that \nevidentiary hearing, try to figure out the problems that that piece of \nevidence might have so that I can use it to break down the case.  \nThat's gonna happen.  It's gonna happen carte blanche.  It's gonna be \nan automatic thing in every case where an Order of Protection is \nissued.  I'm gonna try to gum up the works.  That's my job.  I'm trying \nto zealously advocate for my client.  \nI think that this is gonna be a real problem for \ndomestic violence victims.  Even if they don't have to testify at a \nhearing, they are going to be struggling with the fact that that Order of \nProtection that they're relying upon to protect them from their abuser \nmight end up getting thrown out in court five days after it was issued.  \nAnd, you know, that's a scary proposition.  \nI think there are, you know, substance problems with \nthis bill.  That there -- there really aren't -- it really isn't as clear as it \nprobably should be.  I think it creates a lot of extra work for our local \ncourts, especially in rural communities.  And I also think it creates a \nlot of extra work for our superior courts.  I think there's a way to \ncodify Crawford .  You know, I don't think it needs to go through the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n339Criminal Procedure Law.  I think there's -- just like, you know, if \nproperty's taken in a criminal case, a -- the -- the person whose \nproperty is taken from them, they can have a replevin action in -- in -- \nin a -- a civil court.  I think there's a way that we could do this in a \ncivil court that gives people the opportunity to challenge an Order of \nProtection.  I know Orders of Protection are often modified in family \ncourt.  \nSo I think this is problematic as written and \nunnecessary, and I'll be voting no and I would encourage everyone \nelse to vote no as well. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.   \nRead the last section. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Gandolfo. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nThe Republican Conference will generally be opposed to this bill; \nhowever, any members who wish to vote yes may do so at their desks.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Madam Speaker, the \nMajority Conference is gonna be in favor of this piece of legislation.  \nThere may be a few that desire to be an exception.  They should feel \nfree to do so at their seats. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n340ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nThe Clerk will record the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMs. Septimo to explain her vote. \nMS. SEPTIMO:  I want to highlight that this piece of \nlegislation came to be because of a woman named Shamika Crawford, \nwho went through an incredibly difficult experience of being rendered \nhomeless, of losing her children for months, and having to rebuild her \nlife after that.  Miss Crawford has been here in Albany to advocate on \nthis issue many times, and I personally want to extend my gratitude to \nher for turning her painful experience into a powerful one that will \nhelp everyone in our justice system get a little bit closer to realizing \nwhat justice actually means here in New York.  And that means \nhaving your voice heard whether you are accused or whether you're a \nvictim.  This bill will make it so that everyone has a chance to walk \ninto a courtroom and have their story heard for what it is and have \njudges make decisions accordingly.  \nSo I want to thank everyone who has advocated on \nthis bill, but especially Miss Crawford.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Septimo in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                       JUNE 11, 2025\n341MRS.

Sandy has \nbeen a tremendous leader in the community, but this entire process \nhelp bring us together in a way that has connected us as family.

BLUMENCRANZ:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  \nIt is my distinct honor to rise today to welcome to the \nChamber His Excellency Ambassador Ofir Akunis, Consul General of \nIsrael in New York.  A statesman of principle, a defender of \ndemocracy, and a lifelong advocate for innovation and international \npartnerships, Ambassador Akunis' distinguished career spans decades \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n7of public service.  From his time as Minister of Science and \nTechnology to his leadership in the Knesset, he has consistently \nworked to advance Israel's role as a global leader in scientific \ndiscovery, regional diplomacy, and human progress.  \nAs the Ranking Member of the Assembly's Science \nand Technology Committee, I have a deep appreciation for the \nAmbassador's efforts to harness innovation for public good, whether \nit's AI, clean energy, cyber security or bio -- biomedical research.  \nThese are the areas where the State of Israel and New York can and \nmust collaborate more closely, and this visit lays the groundwork for \nthat shared future.\nBut today is about more than science and diplomacy.  \nIt's about solidarity.  As a young Jewish legislator, I cannot stand here \nwithout addressing the rise of anti-Semitic violence from college \ncampuses to neighborhoods across our nation, including the horrific \nrecent stabbing incident in Boulder.  Moments like this demand \nclarity, courage and unity.  And I am proud to say this is not a partisan \nmoment.  Across party lines and geography, members of this Body \nhave come together to say with the Ambassador, hatred has no home \nhere in New York.  Not now, not ever.  We are here to affirm our \ncommitment to the Jewish neighbors who strengthen our bond and our \ndemocratic ally, and ensure that Israelis and Israeli New Yorkers have \naccess to Consulate services and institutional support they need, from \npassports to protection to everything in between.\nMadam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you extend \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n8the privileges and cordialities of the floor to Ambassador Ofir Akunis, \nand we thank him for his lifetime of public service, and we welcome \nhim to the People's House. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On behalf of Mr. \nBlumencranz, the Speaker and all members, we welcome you, \nAmbassador, to the Chamber, extend the privileges of the floor to you.  \nWe hope you enjoy our proceedings today.

WEPRIN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nThis bill will help millions of Americans of all ages \nwho have -- had suffered with stuttering and were not able to get the \ntherapy training that they needed to prevent stuttering and to improve \nstuttering.  We've had -- we had a special guest here for a number of \nweeks, Michael Kidd Gilchrist, who is a former NBA player, a Hall of \nFamer, and someone who has become a national spokesperson for \nstuttering and preventing stuttering.  \nThis legislation has been long in the making.  It's \nsomething that is -- is very needed, and no one should not get the help \nthey need to deal with their stuttering issue because they can't afford \nco-payments and they can't afford therapy for this.  \nSo this bill will go a long way.  I just urge everyone \nto -- to vote for this and to speak out for issues like this for coverage. \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Weprin in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

An act to amend the \nExecutive Law, in relation to codifying the disparate impact standard \nin the Human Rights Law.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.  \nMr. Lasher.  \nWe're on debate.  Quiet in the Chamber, please. \nMR. LASHER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  And I \nwant to thank my colleague Assemblymember Wright, who has been \nmy partner in this effort which began at the start of both of our terms \nin office. \nThis simple but important bill would ensure that New \nYorkers continue to have strong legal protections from housing \ndiscrimination.  It would incorporate the disparate impact standard, \nwhich has long been in effect for purposes of fair housing enforcement \nunder Federal law, into State law, and specifically into Article 15 of \nthe State's Executive Law, the Human Rights Law.  \nBoth the Federal Fair Housing Act and the State \nHuman Rights Law prohibit discrimination in the provision of housing \nand credit to New Yorkers, and have been critical tools in ensuring \nequal access to housing in our State.  The Federal law, however, has \nlong been a more powerful tool than the State Human Rights Law \nwhen it comes to housing discrimination because of what is known as \nthe disparate impact or discriminatory effects standard.  To make a \nfair housing claim under Federal law, a plaintiff, or in many cases the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n11State Attorney General, must show that a policy or practice has the \neffect or impact of discriminating without having to prove intent.  This \nhas been critical to fair housing enforcement because intent is hard to \nprove in many contexts, and because discriminatory acts are often \ndisguised thinly or otherwise.  The State law, however, does not come \nwith the long line of bedrock jurisprudence  reinforcing the disparate \nimpact standard, nor do we have something equivalent to the Federal \nregulation first put on the books in 2013, codifying the disparate \nimpact standard.  But the weakness of the State law has historically \nbeen irrelevant because of the Federal jurisprudence  and regulation. \nThis legislation is straightforward.  It incorporates the \nFederal disparate impact standard into the State Human Rights Law \nfor fair housing cases; nothing more, nothing less.  It would mean that \nthe State law is no longer weaker than the Federal law, and clarify any \nquestion now or in the future about whether claims brought under \nState law must meet some higher burden than the disparate impact \nstandard.  I should stress, anyone who has followed the law as it has \nstood for the last 50 years would continue to be in compliance under \nthis legislation.  \nAnd I should note finally that the bill takes its \nlanguage almost verbatim from the Federal regulation on disparate \nimpact, and would merely preserve the legal status quo of the last \nhalf-century to ensure that New Yorkers continue to have protection \nand recourse to ensure fair and equal access to housing in our great \nState. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n12ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. LASHER:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.  And I do \nappreciate the -- the thorough introduction to this -- to this issue.  It's \nappreciated, and it -- it eliminated a few of my opening questions.  So \nlet's -- let's kind of get to it. \nI -- when selecting a forum in a housing complaint or \nin a housing matter, doesn't the complainant or the claimant have an \nability to elect between proceeding in a Federal direction or a State \nHuman Rights direction?  \nMR. LASHER:  Many, if not most, claims of housing \ndiscrimination involve both State and Federal claims and sometimes \nlocal claims as well. \nMS. WALSH:  I'm sorry, I missed that last part.  I \napologize. \nMR. LASHER:  Most housing discrimination cases, I \n-- I don't know if most -- many, if not most, housing discrimination \ncases brought in New York --\nMS. WALSH:  Yes.\nMR. LASHER: -- make claims under both Federal \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n13and State law. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So in that way, what I'm \nfamiliar with, early in my practice I did some employment \ndiscrimination work where you had the EEOC and then you had the \nDivision of Human Rights, and very often you would -- you would -- \nyou usually did better as a -- as a plaintiff under the EEOC, at that \ntime anyway -- and this is millions of years ago; like 30 years ago --   \nbecause you could get better damages and you could get some \nattorney's fees paid if you went under the EEOC versus the Division of \nHuman Rights.  Would you say -- and I don't want to get too far afield \nfrom the bill and we'll circle back to it -- but would you say that a \ncomparison in the realm of housing would be similar to that you \nwould -- you would plead -- you would plead in both -- in both \nforums?  \nMR. LASHER:  You know, I've looked at a lot of \nthese complaints and they generally take the form of making a claim \nunder Federal law, a claim under State law, and asserting the disparate \nimpact standard, sort of generally speaking.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. LASHER:  So I -- I'm not quite sure the analogy \nis quite the same. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Are the remedies the same if \nyou go through the Federal -- so Federal would be the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, and then \nthere's the New York City Commission on Human Rights, and then \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n14there's the New York State Division of Human Rights.  I think that \nthose would be like the three possible areas that you could pursue if \nyou had a housing complaint, depending on where you live. \nMR. LASHER:  You know, the -- the Human Rights \nLaw is enforceable both through the Division of Human Rights and \nthrough litigation. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  All right. \nSo one question I had is, under New York's current \nlaw with the Division of Human Rights, if -- if we look at that, isn't -- \nisn't disparate impact already an available theory even if it's not got \nthe standard spelled out as you do here in this bill?  \nMR. LASHER:  I want to be circumspect about what \nI'll say on that question, and I would simply say that there is a 50-year \nline of Federal jurisprudence  that makes it unquestionable that the \ndisparate impact standard is applicable to the Fair Housing Act of \n1964, and there's not a comparable line of State jurisprudence . \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So it -- it may be an avail --  \nare -- would it be fair to say, then, that it -- disparate impact is already \nan available theory that could be brought before the New York State \nDivision of Human Rights, but because of possible changes at the \nFederal level there was a feeling to file this bill at the end of January \nof this year, so right after the new Administration came in, and just to \n-- to really lock it down and make sure that that disparate impact \nstandard was in our State law?  \nMR. LASHER:  I think I should note that I was \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n15working on this legislation prior to the incoming Administration. \nMS. WALSH:  Like around mid- November , maybe, \nof last year?  \nMR. LASHER:  No, look, I think -- I think -- look, I \n-- you know, we live in a changing world.\nMS. WALSH:  Yes.\nMR. LASHER:  We had the Loper Bright decision in \nthe -- at the Supreme Court last year that changes the landscape of \ndeference to agency regulation.  The last time the Supreme Court took \nthis issue up was a decade ago.  So we live in a changing world.  This \nhas been the status quo for 50 years.  I think it has been an important \ntool to protect New Yorkers from housing discrimination, and this \nlegislation would ensure that that tool continues to remain, regardless \nof what may come. \nMS. WALSH:  That's -- that -- okay. \nSo, as I was looking at kind of ideas of what a -- a \ndisparate impact case could be, the -- I guess the first thing that \nimmediately came to my mind was something that we've mentioned \nhere before, which is redlining.  Although that -- that might be \nsomething where there is a discrim -- a discrimin -- I can't even say it, \nsorry -- discriminatory intent, but -- but perhaps that would be difficult \nto prove.  So a disparate impact standard could be helpful in trying to \nestablish any kind of modern-day redlining.  Would that be fair to say?  \nMR. LASHER:  That's -- that is exactly right. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n16Another -- another thought that Google helped me \nthink of was that let's say you have, for example, a -- a landlord that \nsays, You know , I'm gonna create a rule here that says that I don't \nwant to see any individual tenant calling 911 more than twice every \nsix months or -- or that's it , and then that could disparately impact, for \nexample, a survivor of domestic violence or family members in that \nfamily unit who might need to call three times or four times.  And if \nthat results in an eviction of that tenant, that could be possibly a claim \nsaying that that rule that the landlord put out is -- is going to have a \ndisparate impact on that tenant.  \nMR. LASHER:  Well, you know, I'll give you -- \nMS. WALSH:  That class of tenant.\nMR. LASHER:  I'll give you an example.  Yeah, I'll \ngive you an example.  You know, there was a very fascinating case in \n2014 in Buffalo --\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMR. LASHER:  -- that the Attorney General brought \nagainst Evans Bank.  And the case emerged from the fact that Evans \nBank was intentionally excluding predominantly African-American \nneighborhoods from its lending area, it was developing mortgage \nlending products that it made unavailable to those neighborhoods.  It \nrefused to solicit customers in those neighborhoods.  And lo and \nbehold, when the Attorney General's Office looked at the mortgage \napplications, just four of 1,114 mortgage applications came from \napplicants of any race for the property in the East Side neighborhood \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n17of Buffalo, and of those applications from the East Side \nneighborhoods, only one came from a Black applicant.  And that was \na kind of a classic case of a disparate impact pleading where the \nactions of the bank led to this extraordinarily disparate impact racially \ndiscriminatory effect. \nMS. WALSH:  That's a helpful example.  I appreciate \nit. \nI think that really you've answered the -- well, you \nknow what?  Let's just -- no, you kind of covered it, though, in your \nexplanation as far as how this works and what the standard is going to \nbe.  And you mentioned, I just would underline, that the -- the actual \nstandard is drawn heavily from the Federal definition of disparate \nimpact.  Are you -- it's lifted. \nMR. LASHER:  It -- it is almost verbatim --\nMS. WALSH:  Almost verbatim.\nMR. LASHER:  -- and where it is not verbatim it is \nonly because the -- you know, we refer to a paragraph and they refer \nto a subdivision.  You know, it -- it is --  it is substantively verbatim \nfrom the Federal regulation. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I \nappreciate it, Mr. Lasher.\nMR. LASHER:  Thank you.\nMS. WALSH:  Madam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  So, there are really two ways to look \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n18at this bill and this kind of bill.  We spoke -- soon after the November  \nelection occurred, there was a lot of discussion about the need to -- to \nTrump-proof our laws here in reaction to what the campaign had \nindicated was a priority.  And we've seen that through a flurry of \nExecutive Orders that have been brought since taking office in \nJanuary that the President has indicated, and I'll mention it \nspecifically, there's an Executive Order, 14281 from April 23rd of \n2025 that states that it is the policy of the United States to eliminate \nthe use of disparate impact liability in all contexts to the maximum \ndegree possible to avoid violating the Constitution's Federal Civil \nRights Laws and basic American ideals.  And it does go on.  So, you \nknow, I -- I used to have -- I'm not a really anxious person by nature, \nbut I always had this sign on my desk and it always helped me.  And it \nsaid, You need to worry about the things that are actually happening , \nnot the things that might possibly happen.  Right?  So that helps me to \nbe less anxious, because I try not to worry about all the things that \nmight possibly happen down the line.  But I understand the point of \nview that I believe that the sponsor holds, which is that if you have an \nExecutive Order like this that came out in April -- although I know \nthat he indicated that he had been working on this bill for some time --  \nbut when you have that, even though that Executive Order doesn't \nactually roll back anything, it doesn't really do anything except for \nlater in the Executive Order it talks about that there's going to be a \nreview, that there's going to be a report.  That's there's gonna be \npossible future agency action.  All of that's possible right now under \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n19our Federal law.  That disparate impact statement or standard is still in \nthere.  But I can appreciate that some members may feel like, well, \nthen what is the harm, then, just to be -- just to be on the safe side to \ntake that disparate impact standard and put it into our own State \nHuman Rights Law so that if, if something happens at the Federal \nlevel and if that is challenged and it withstands legal challenge, if, if, \nif down the road that something happens, then we're all set here in \nNew York.  \nSo I would expect that there -- there will be some \nmembers who will want to support this for that reason.  There may be \nother people who say, You know what?  Disparate  impact as a theory \nhas been raised in State housing cases under the Human Rights Law \nfor a very long time and it shows no immediate signs of going away \nand it can continue to be brought.  So we don't need to take that \naction at this time.\nSo I think that that kind of explains the bill for \neverybody.  I think that there will be a divergence of opinions \ndepending on where you fall on it.  \nSo, Madam Speaker, I thank you for the time and I \nthank the sponsor for the -- the debate.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mrs. Peoples- \nStokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  Will the sponsor yield for one -- one quick question?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n20yield?  \nMR. LASHER:  Absolutely.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.\nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, sir.\nI wonder if you could review the data that you \nmentioned regarding the East Side of Buffalo --\nMR. LASHER:  Certainly.\nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  -- and the impact of it in \nthis legislation. \nMR. LASHER:  Sure.  And I -- I should note that -- \nthat Evans Bank settled with the Attorney General's Office on this \ncase.  This was in a case brought in 2014, and this was from the \nAttorney General's complaint in the case.  I'll just read from the -- \nfrom the complaint.  Of 1,114 mortgage applications, only four \napplications .36 percent, came from applicants reporting as \nAfrican-American, and only eight applications .72 percent, came from \napplicants of any race with a property in the East Side neighborhoods.  \nOf the mortgage applications from the East Side neighborhoods, only \none .009 percent, was from an applicant reporting as African- \nAmerican. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you.  And -- and \nI want to suspect that your legislation will get us to the equality and \njustice that we mention every time we say our Pledge of Allegiance \nfor people across the State of New York. \nMR. LASHER:  It -- it aims to be a step toward that \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n21goal. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, sir. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection. \nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  A Party vote has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Walsh.  \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  The \nRepublican Conference will generally be in the negative on this piece \nof legislation.  But there may be some who wish to vote yes, and they \nmay certainly do so now at their seats.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  The Majority Conference is generally gonna be in favor of \nthis piece of consumer-friendly, equitable legislation; however, there \nmay be a few of us that would desire to be an exception.  If they do so \nthey should do so at their seats.  Thank you, ma'am. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nThe Clerk will record the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMr. Wright to explain his vote. \nMR. WRIGHT:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I just \nwant to offer a big thank you to Member Lasher for partnering on this \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n22legislation with him.  And housing is a human right and I'm excited \nthat this piece of legislation is gonna go through, and if we continue to \nhave that in our great State of New York and I proudly vote in the \naffirmative. \nThank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Wright in the affirmative.\nMr. Lavine to explain his vote. \nMR. LAVINE:  In his April 23rd Executive Order, \nour President said that 55 years of Supreme Court precedent as first \ndeclared in Griggs v. Duke Power in 1970 are going to be overturned.  \nDisparate impact theory has to be gotten rid of, quote, \"to the degree \npossible\", unquote.  \nNew York has a proud history of civil rights, and I \nwant to commend the sponsor.  And I'll commend, as well, everyone \nwho will vote in favor of this very meaningful piece of legislation.  \nBecause we need to continue that history, and we really need to \ncontinue that history when we have an Executive, a Chief Executive \nin Washington who does not believe in civil rights.\nAnd so I am going to be very proud and pleased to \ncast my vote in the affirmative.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Lavine in the \naffirmative.\nMs. Levenberg to explain her vote.\nMS. LEVENBERG:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n23I'd like to also commend the sponsor of this bill.  I grew up in \nTeaneck, New Jersey, where -- where our community took on housing \nand redlining head-on, early on.  And I couldn't be more proud to \nstand with the sponsor and my colleagues to make sure we codify this \ninto law.  Whatever we can do to continue to protect civil rights, \nwhich are human rights, we need to do.  And certainly at this time \nwhen our Federal Government is doing anything but that, we need to \nstand strong together here in New York and stand for what we know is \nright. \nThank you again.  I will vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMs. Levenberg in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)\nThe bill is passed. \nPage 20, Calendar No. 59, the Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  Assembly No. A06332-A, Calendar \nNo. 59, Romero, Cunningham, Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas, Yeger, Woerner, \nSayegh, Colton, Shimsky, McDonald, Levenberg, Schiavoni, \nMorinello, Wright.  An act to amend the Criminal Procedure Law, in \nrelation to notifying certain crime victims of the disposition of \ncriminal trial.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMs. Romero. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n24MS. ROMERO:  Thank you.  I want to first start by \ncommending my colleague across the aisle, the Ranker of Codes, \nJudge Morinello, for the incredible work that they did with me on \ncreating this final legislation. \nThere's a fundamental need for crime victims to be \nkept informed concerning the criminal justice process in which they \nhave become involved, and in some cases, crime victims can lose \ntrack of the state of their case.  So this legislation would require the \ndistrict attorney's office or their designee to mail the final disposition \nof the case, in a felony case, to the crime victim at the final end of the \ncase, whether it's an acquittal at trial or sentencing at the end of the -- \nthe criminal case. \nSo I'm happy to put this legislation forward and I'll \ntake any questions. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Walsh. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will the \nsponsor yield for some questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMS. ROMERO:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields.  \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you very much.\nSo first of all, I guess, let's -- let's start with this.  The \n-- the bill was amended to make a change.  Could you just discuss  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n25what that change was and why you made it?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Sure.  So in the original version of \nthe bill it was a court clerk notification, and the bill was amended, \nfrankly, with my colleague's suggestion to have the district attorney or \ntheir designee provide the mailing to the crime victim, and that's \nbecause the district attorney, frankly, would have the most up-to-date \ninformation of the crime victim as opposed to the court clerk. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So just quickly on that.  So \nwhen it says designee, who is envisioned be a designee at the district \nattorney's office?  \nMS. ROMERO:  The designee would probably be -- \nwould definitely be, actually, the Crime Victims Unit within the \ndistrict attorney's office. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Because I know that -- and \nagain, my practice is more in family court so I might, you know, not \nhave the right person.  But I know that sometimes, particularly if it's a \nsurvivor -- the person is a survivor of domestic violence, for example, \nsometimes there's a specific advocate that works with the court to help \nthat individual.  Could they be a designee that would be -- could be \ntasked with the notification?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Yes.  So those -- those advocates \nare underneath the district attorney's office --\nMS. WALSH:  (Indiscernible/crosstalk)\nMS. ROMERO:  Exactly.  We're -- we're thinking of \nthe same office.  Those people would have the most up-to-date \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n26information of -- of the crime victim. \nMS. WALSH:  That's -- that's exactly right.  I -- I \nhadn't -- I hadn't remembered that.  That's how their -- that's how their \nposition is funded.  I remember that now.  Okay.\nSo, now, it seemed to me from reading this that the \nnotice was going -- the written notice was going to need to issue if --   \nif it's at the person -- the victim was not present at the time of \nsentencing or acquitted after trial?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Correct.  \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.\nMS. ROMERO:  So those are the two potential \ndispositions of a -- of a felony case.  An acquittal after trial or \nsentencing, in which case there's many outcomes of sentencing; \nprobation, you know, fined, incarceration or an acquittal which would \nbe a trial and... \nMS. WALSH:  But it -- the need for the notice is \njudged upon whether that -- that person, that -- that crime victim, was \npresent at either one of those things?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Correct. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  So, for example, there -- there \nmay be some crime victims who just, for whatever reason, they are -- \nthey're not present, but they're keeping in really close contact with the \ndistrict attorney's office and they know the outcome.  They would still \nneed to get a written notice?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Correct. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n27MS. WALSH:  Okay.  And how -- I mean, do they \nhave to try -- like, they just have to mail it out, right?  They just have \nto mail -- mail or e-mail or... \nMS. ROMERO:  Mail. \nMS. WALSH:  Mail.  Okay, first-class mail to the last \nknown address.  Okay. \nWhat -- is there -- is there something that led to the \ndevelopment of this bill?  Like, do you think that this is a problem that \nneeds to be fixed and why?  \nMS. ROMERO:  So my -- in my work in the public \ndefender's office for almost a decade before I was elected to the New \nYork State Assembly, I saw that crime victims, through -- of no \nreason -- of no reason that I -- I'm aware of, maybe because their lives \nare busy or -- or for whatever reason, occasionally don't show up to \ncourt.  But they should still have notice or explicit information of \nwhat's going on in their case.  And I believe that that obligation is in \nthe hands of the district attorney's office to let them know exactly \nwhat's happening on every step of the way.  So if they for whatever \nreason do not appear for the last actual appearance in court, they \nshould still know exactly what's happening on that last possible court \ndate.  That's extremely important.  There's really important things that \nhappen on that last court date.  Orders of Protection are issues -- are \nissued.  There's intense levels of incarceration that are issued.  \nSometimes on the last day of court there's open times of sentencing.  \nSometimes sentences are so open that it could be probation or \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n28incarceration.  If they don't appear for court that day, they might not \neven know what the defendant is even being sentenced to.  So it's \nimportant that this bill, when -- if and when passed, would allow for \nthe crime victim to know exactly what's happening, irregardless of \nwhether or not they're showing up to court. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  \nSo it says in the bill that there needs to be a written \nsummary of the disposition of such felony.  What do you envision \nbeing in that written disposition?  Is it just simply sentenced to X \namount of time?  Is it acquitted following trial?  Or is it -- does it have \nto give -- does it have to give more than that, and if so -- I mean, the \nbill appears to be silent on that. \nMS. ROMERO:  A final disposition of a case would \ninclude sentencing, meaning in the plain language of what a sentence \nmeans.  A sentence in a criminal case includes fines.  It could include \n-- it includes the actual sentence, which is probation, prison, \nincarceration.  It includes surcharges.  It is -- when I say final \ndisposition I mean the legal definition thereof, which is the \naforementioned things that I just -- \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  That's helpful.  Yeah, because \nI was wondering if it would also include things like a summary of the \nproceedings.  You're -- you're just talking about the outcome.\nMS. ROMERO:  Correct.\nMS. WALSH:  The actually outcome; fines, \nsentencing, et cetera, that that's what they're gonna be notified of.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n29MS. ROMERO:  It would also include Orders of \nProtection. \nMS. WALSH:  Orders of Protection.  Absolutely.\nMS. ROMERO:  Correct.  It would include the actual \nfinal disposition.  But to get directly to your point, it would not \ninclude a summary of the proceedings.  It would include the outcome \nof the case that was imposed on the defendant and the effects it would \nhave on the crime victim, i.e., the Order of Protection most notably. \nMS. WALSH:  What -- what would be your response \nto what I have heard a little bit about the bill which says, like I say to \nmy kids all the time, Hey, the phone works both ways .  You know?  \nAnd I don't mean to be flip about it.  But, you know, like if -- if there \nis a crime victim that wants to know what's going on with the case, \nthey have only to call their -- their contact the district attorney's office \nand find out.  And if they're not and if there's no contact going on \nthen, you know, like, what do you -- I mean, what do you have to say \nto that argument?  \nMS. ROMERO:  What I have to say to that is that I -- \nI want to protect victims no matter what's going on in their life, and I \nbelieve that to my core.  And, you know, I've seen personally in my \ninvolvement in the criminal legal system that sometimes there's \nsomething going on in their life.  They miss -- they miss the bus.  \nThey can't get child care that day.  They are unable to -- there's \nsomething else going on in their life that they can't make that one \nsingle court date at that one specific time.  And because that one \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n30specific court date at 9 a.m. is -- is very, very impactful for the rest of \ntheir life, they miss that very important piece of information.  And so \n-- and they want to be there for that.  So this bill would give them all \nof that information in writing directly to them if they miss that court \ndate.  The -- I -- what I say to you in response to your question is I feel \nlike the district attorney's office has an obligation to tell crime victims \nabout the outcome of their case because they should. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  And just -- I appreciate that.  \nAnd so, just to figure out again just to clarify the scope of this.  It's -- \nat -- after trial -- (indiscernible) acquittal after trial or the sentencing \nof any defendant for a felony.  So if the sentencing ends up being for \nsomething less than a felony, do they still notify or not?  \nMS. ROMERO:  No, this is just for felony cases. \nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  A felony disposition.\nMS. ROMERO:  Yes.\nMS. WALSH:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I \nappreciate your answers.\nMadam Speaker, on the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMS. WALSH:  I do thank the sponsor for clarifying a \nfew things about the bill.  I think -- you know, I think that -- and, \nagain, I -- I bring an Upstate perspective to this.  Maybe things are \ndifferent in other parts of the State and that's really what's led -- what's \nled to the bill.  But the DA's offices that I am familiar with, their -- \ntheir ADAs are very, very much in -- in contact with the crime \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n31victims. Their -- their whole purpose is to try to bring justice for these \nindividuals.  And so they're -- they're in very regular contact with \ncrime victims, either by phone or -- I can absolutely appreciate the \nidea that if the -- if the crime victim can't actually be there at the time \nof acquittal following trial or sentencing or can't come in and do their \nvictim impact statement or, you know, just life gets in the way and \nthey can't be there.  Or they can't just emotionally can't be there.  I can \nreally appreciate that.  But we do have -- we do have other means of \ncommunication with the DA's office that I think can be as effective.  \nI do think that the amendment that was made by the \nsponsor is a -- is a good one.  I think that before, it would have \nrequired the clerk of the court or their designee to mail the written \nsummary, and then the amendment on third reading changed that to \nthe district attorney or their designee, and I think that that's more \nappropriately the place where a notice should be coming from, and I \ndo think that that was a good change.  \nI think that many of us will support this legislation.  \nBut I also would say that in -- in my experience and I think probably \nin the vast majority of situations, the DA's offices are very much on \ntop of this and it is really their whole reason, is to try to make sure that \nthere is justice brought to crime victims and they are keeping in touch.  \nBut I -- I do -- you know, I will probably support this legislation, \nespecially with the amendment, because I do think that a letter and a \nstamp is probably not too much to ask for -- for our crime victims.\nSo, but I thank the sponsor very much for her \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n32answers, and thank you, Madam Speaker. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Morinello. \nMR. MORINELLO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MORINELLO:  I would like to commend the \nsponsor.  The -- the cooperation between both sides of the aisle on this \nparticular issue exemplifies what this Body should be here for.  The \ncooperation should be there to make bills better, and the willingness to \nbe able to discuss the issues, to point out certain flaws or \ninconsistencies that might be there. \nI was the assigned domestic violence judge for ten \nyears, and it was a smaller court, unlike the sponsor's court that she \nhad to deal with.  And what happens is the -- the principle in domestic \nviolence is power and control, and the abuser maintains power and \ncontrol over the victim.  The victim needs to be made feel -- feel like \nthey are being listened to.  That they have some rights.  Because in \norder for an abuser to actually have to come to court or to be charged \nis very, very difficult emotionally for the victim.  The victims, it may \ntake four or five attempts for them to be able to go forward in the \ncourts.  Their fear is still there, and many times they have to be \nprotected from their abuser's just stares, sneers.  There -- there are just \noutbursts that may happen in a courtroom.  So many times, a -- an \nabused victim may choose not to come to court if there -- the district \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n33attorney's office feels there's other evidence on a particular matter.  \nMany times it's a witness that will report it and not the victim. \nUnfortunately, many times in the budget in this State \nfrom when I was on the bench, I've seen funds cut for domestic \nviolence advocates, and the district attorneys have had to work with \nless individuals.  Therefore, sometimes they lose contact.  \nThis Body, in its wisdom, has passed laws to protect \nthe identity, location and phone numbers of victims.  We have passed \nlaws to allow them to get out of leases so they can escape dangerous \nsituations.  It is really important at the conclusion of a matter that that \nvictim feels like they are worth something.  A piece of paper is more \nimportant to them than we can ever imagine.  And I feel that with the \ncooperation on this bill that it accomplishes the goal that we need, and \nthat is to make a victim feel whole, feel listened to, and feel protected. \nThank you to the sponsor, and thank you again. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Will \nthe sponsor yield?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Certainly. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you.\nIs the definition of victim defined in the Criminal \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n34Procedure Law or the Penal Law?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. ROMERO:  I don't know. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Do you antici -- \nMS. ROMERO:  But I -- but I think it takes the \nnormal and commonsense definition of crime victim in the sense that \nthey are the aggrieved person in the criminal action. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So this particular piece of \nlegislation would require the DA's office to provide notice of \ndisposition to any aggrieved party as a result of a criminal conviction \nor an acquittal?  \nMS. ROMERO:  This would require the district \nattorney to mail the final disposition of the case to the named crime \nvictim in a criminal action. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So the named victim in an \nindictment, for example. \nMS. ROMERO:  Yes. \nMR. MOLITOR:  All right.  So if -- and thank you \nfor clarifying that.  So if a victim is not named in the indictment, the \ndistrict attorney's office would not be required to mail a disposition to \nthe victim?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. ROMERO:  This is a great question, and I see \nwhere you're going with that.  Because there can be a crime victim for \nan Order of Protection.  There can be a crime victim for an \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n35indictment.  And I thank you for this question because I think -- and I \n-- I would clarify for the bill that there would be any crime victim for \npurposes of the -- the crime itself.  So thank you for the question.  And \nthe victim itself for purposes of the crime is any crime victim for \npurposes of the crime itself.  And the district attorney's office knows \nwho the crime victims are in each crime and each case. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So what about those circumstances \nwhere, let's say, just as an example, a town clerk steals hundreds of \nthousands of dollars from a local municipality.  All the victims in that \ncase would be the taxpayers of that particular area.  Would the district \nattorney's office have to provide written notice of a disposition to all \nof those people in that particular instance?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Yes. \nMR. MOLITOR:  They would?  \nMS. ROMERO:  According to the written version of \nthe bill, yeah. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  That -- that could impose a \npretty massive burden on district -- district attorney's offices that don't \nhave the capability to do that, wouldn't it?  \nMS. ROMERO:  It can be their designees as well.  So \nthere can be a version of the district attorney that is not necessarily the \ndistrict attorney's office. \nMR. MOLITOR:  What -- what do you mean?  I don't \n-- I'm sorry, I don't understand.\n(Conferencing)\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n36MS. ROMERO:  It can be a massive mailing.  It \ndoesn't have to be one person that sends it out, and it can be a massive \nmailer that goes out to the crime victims themselves.  I also think that \nmail, as a concept, can also be electronic mail. \nMR. MOLITOR:  It can be electronic mail. \nMS. ROMERO:  It says mail, and mail, as generally \ndefined, can be -- it doesn't have to necessarily be first-class mail, it \ncan be electronic mail as well. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  Now, what about those \ncircumstances where there -- there isn't yet a final disposition on a \ncase?  And -- and I -- let me just give you an example here.  Like, \nwhat about where the -- the defendant pleads guilty and enters into \ntreatment court?  Let's say judicial diversion.  They might not have a \n-- a sentence for two or three years down the road.  Would a DA's \noffice still be required to wait until the -- the end of that procedure to \nprovide notice to any crime victim?  \nMS. ROMERO:  No.  When someone enters \ntreatment court the sentence is held in advance, and it's held in \nadvance until they are finished with the treatment court, at which time \nthey're finally sentenced when they're completed with the treatment \ncourt.  \nMR. MOLITOR:  So the -- the district attorney's \noffice would be required to provide a notice of the disposition upon \nthe completion of treatment court?  \nMS. ROMERO:  Upon the final disposition.  So the \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n37final disposition doesn't happen until they're sentenced and completed. \nMR. MOLITOR:  And that could be two or three \nyears down the road, right? \nMS. ROMERO:  Correct. \nMR. MOLITOR:  What about those instances where \nsomebody's sentenced to, let's say, felony probation and then a couple \nyears go by, there's a violation of probation and then they're \nresentenced to maybe a period of incarceration?  Would the district \nattorney's office have to provide a new notice of disposition upon \nresentencing?  \n(Conferencing)\nMS. ROMERO:  Not as written.  It doesn't speak to \nthat in the bill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Okay.  Thank you for answering \nmy questions.\nOn the bill. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. MOLITOR:  So I -- I think the intent of this \nparticular legislation is good -- is good intent.  I think it is important \nthat DA's offices notify crime victims.  I will tell you, in my years of \nexperience as a district attorney that we did -- we do this already.  We \nall -- most DA's offices across the State, if not all of them, have a \nrobust criminal victim, I guess, group of people that reach out to \ncriminal victims and help them and notify them of every step of the --  \nyou know, along the way.  We're already required by statute to notify \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n38victims of sentencing dates and to provide information to victims upon \nthe completion of sentence.  I don't know any DA, I can't think of \nanybody that I've met in my entire career, who wouldn't want to notify \na crime victim of what happened in a case. \nThe problem I have with this particular legislation, \nyou know, I -- I didn't come from a DA's office that had 400 attorneys.  \nWe had 12 attorneys.  My caseload was between 100 and 150 cases.  \nAnd, you know, sometimes it's just easier to pick up the phone \nbecause you've already had that relationship with the crime victim and \nsay, Hey, this is what's going on with the case .  And that's all, you \nknow, a crime victim really wants, is they want to be notified what -- \nwhat has happened and they want to be notified soon. \nI also think that this legislation does not take into \nconsideration the incredibly massive burden it will be for DA's offices \nto have to notify every possible aggrieved party in a criminal case.  \nAnd the example that I pointed out is not a far-fetched one.  We've \nhad -- in my county we've had a couple of those cases already.  \nFinancial crimes, in particular, are incredibly difficult to track down \nall the victims.  \nSo while I agree with the intent and the purpose of \nthis legislation, I would just ask everyone to take into consideration \nsome real world practical issues with this bill and vote no on this bill.  \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mrs. Peoples- \nStokes. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n39MRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Madam Speaker, would \nyou please call the Ways and Means Committee to the Speaker's \nConference Room?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ways and Means \nCommittee members to the Speaker's Conference Room.  Ways and \nMeans to the Speaker's Conference Room.   \nRead the last section.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect on the 180th \nday. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.)\nMr. Molitor to explain his vote. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nI -- I just wanted to point out one more major \nfundamental flaw with this bill.  I'm sorry, I don't mean to do this.  But \nthe -- but this bill also doesn't contemplate other prosecuting agencies.  \nI mean, if there's a conflict, then a special prosecutor needs to be \nassigned.  This law doesn't apply to special prosecutors.  It doesn't \naddress the prosecuting agency in New York State, the Attorney \nGeneral's Office.  The Attorney General's Office is prosecuting a \ncrime, they also do not have to follow this law.  This is specific to \nlocal DA's offices, and I just wanted to point that out.  It's another \nproblem with this particular piece of legislation. \nThank you.  I'll be voting in the negative. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n40ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Molitor in the negative.\nMs. Romero to explain her vote. \nMS. ROMERO:  Thank you.  \nSo just a quick point, which is that the 18B Panel or a \nspecial prosecutor would be the designee of the district attorney's \noffice, of course.  An additional point is the thousands of people in a \nmunicipality for, you know, the hypothetical posed in a debate, it's \nkind of a null point in the sense that, you know, if a municipality was \nto be a crime victim in a financial crime, the treasurer would likely be \nthe person to be appearing on behalf of the municipality, not the \nthousands of constituents in that type of hypothetical financial crime. \nI'm so proud to put this bill forward.  I worked so \nincredibly hard on it, and I -- I stand so strong on behalf of crime \nvictims across New York State and I will be voting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Romero in the \naffirmative. \nMr. Jensen to explain his vote. \nMR. JENSEN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, to \nexplain my vote.\nI just want to commend the sponsor as well as my \nfriend from Niagara Falls on the collaboration to take a -- a legislative \nidea, a public policy idea, and really work together to fine tune it and \ncome to a -- a final bill that's before us that I think reenforces what \nmany DA's offices across the State are already doing.  Certainly, I -- I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n41know in the Monroe County District Attorney's Office that the District \nAttorney and her staff works tremendously hard to ensure that victims \nare continually informed about what's happening.  And to ensure that \nvictims across New York State will ensure that they have up-to-date \ninformation on the resolutions of their cases, I think it's important to \nensure that victims not only have their -- their day in court, their \nvoices heard, but continue to have the respect and dignity shown to \nthem by our -- our district attorneys' offices in the State. \nWith that I vote in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Jensen in the \naffirmative.\nMrs. Peoples-Stokes to explain her vote. \nMRS. PEOPLES-STOKES:  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker.  \nI rise to, one, to compliment the sponsor of this \nlegislation, and understanding that while some may be already doing \nwhat's right by the victims in our State, some are not.  And sometimes \nthose who aren't, need to be asked to do that and are required to do it.  \nIt's important that victims are protected through the process and after \nthe process.  Information allows them to be protected. \nSo thank you very much to the sponsor and I'm \npleased to be voting in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mrs. Peoples- \nStokes in the affirmative.\nMs. Shimsky to explain her vote. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n42MS. SHIMSKY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nFor -- for years now we have seen a drop in \nresources, basically Federal resources, going to the protection of crime \nvictims, especially domestic violence victims.  Giving knowledge to \nthose victims is giving them power to protect themselves.  And it's \nsomething that has been coming in shorter and shorter supply.\nSo I, therefore, am very proud to stand with so many \nof my colleagues in favor of a bill that will require that our victims get \nthe most basic resource they needed to protect themselves, and that's \nknowledge.  Knowledge is power.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Ms. Shimsky in the \naffirmative. \nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.)  \nThe bill is passed. \nPage 8, Rules Report No. 262, Clerk will read. \nTHE CLERK:  S01356-A, Rules Report No. 262, \nSenator Skoufis (A03649-B, Taylor, Alvarez, McDonald, Romero, \nMcDonough, K.

An act to amend the Election Law and \nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law, in relation to joining multistate voter list \nmaintenance organizations.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n43ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  An explanation has \nbeen requested.\nMr. Taylor. \nMR. TAYLOR:  Good morning.  Thank you, Madam \nSpeaker. \nThe purpose of this bill is to authorize the State \nBoard of Elections to join a multistate voter list maintenance \norganization such as Electronic Registration Information Center, also \nknown as ERIC. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Mr. Sempolinski. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Would the sponsor yield for a \nfew questions?  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Will the sponsor \nyield? \nMR. TAYLOR:  Absolutely. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The sponsor yields. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I thank you, Mr. Taylor, for \nyielding.  Thank you.\nSo I have a few questions, mostly about sort of how \nof this would operate.  First of all, the bill contemplates that the State \ncould join one or more organizations of this type; is that correct?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  Could you repeat that question for -- \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  I'm sorry.  Yeah, we're all the \nway across the Chamber.\nMR. TAYLOR:  Okay.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n44MR. SEMPOLINSKI:  The bill says we could -- we \nwould join one or more organizations of this type of multistate voter \nlist maintenance organization.  Am -- am I correct?  That's how it's \nphrased.  \nMR. TAYLOR:  Slightly not.  So, it's 25 -- 24 states \nand including D.C. would be 26 that ERIC which is ERIC, which \nwould be -- New York State would be participating in that group.  Not \njust the one, but a total of. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Well, you know, I understand \nthere will be a lot of states.  But I'm on line 13 of page 2.  The State \nBoard of Elections shall join the State as a member in one or more \nmultistate voter list maintenance organizations including, but not \nlimited to, the Electronic Registration Information Center, that would \nbe ERIC, is the preferred vendor.  \nMR. TAYLOR:  My apologies.  You are correct, sir. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  All right. \nNow, so -- so am I correct that then ERIC, the \nElectronic Registration Information Center, is -- is contemplated as \nmentioned in the bill, but is sort of presented as an example of \nsomething we could join.  We could, in theory, join that or something \nelse or others. \nMR. TAYLOR:  Was that a statement or a question?  \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  That's a question. \nMR. TAYLOR:  Okay.  Yes, it could be others but it \nmust be ERIC. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n45MR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  \nNow, am I correct that ERIC is a bipartisan \norganization?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  You are absolutely correct. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  Is there a requirement \nin the bill that any other organizations that the State joins in addition \nto ERIC also be bipartisan?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  No. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  It is your intent that \nany organizations that we join other than ERIC be bipartisan?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  I am hopeful that that will be the \nplace and the space. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  \nNow, what mechanisms does ERIC or any of these \nother organizations, what do they use to maintain the list?  What --   \nhow do they actually perform the function of maintaining the list? \n(Conferencing)\nMR. TAYLOR:  So, New York State Board of \nElections will -- will provide their voter registration information to \nERIC.  And ERIC operates on other entities as well, so they would be \nutilizing the Social Security -- U.S. Social -- U.S. Post Office as well \nas the Social Security, their death-- death data. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So am I correct that they \nwould be operating based on sort of other publicly-available \ninformation to -- to sort of clean the list?  Is that sort of the function \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n46they would -- the mechanism of by which they would function?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  That is correct. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay. \nIf someone is removed from the list in error, how \nwould they get back on the list?  \n(Conferencing)\nMR. TAYLOR:  ERIC does not remove anyone from \nthe list.  Again, this is New York State sharing information, but New \nYork State, the State Department of Education maintains their \nresponsibilities of sharing with the local municipalities their \ninformation as they receive it.  So if someone is not registered and it \ncomes back that person is ineligible for whatever reason, then they \nwill receive notification that says, You did not qualify  or, You are \nqualified to vote .  And if you're not a citizen you do not get an \nopportunity to vote. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Right.  So -- so ERIC would \nbe providing information to the State to say John Doe or Jane Doe, we \nthink they may have died, we think they may have moved, you should \nlook into them.  Is that (indiscernible)?\nMR. TAYLOR:  Absolutely.  The State does not \nrelinquish any of its authority.  It maintains, and no one else outside of \nNew York State Board of Elections will touch or interfere with their \ndata. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you \nvery much. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n47Regarding privacy.  I just want to clarify for the \nrecord that -- and I'm on, once again, on page 2 and on line 46, and \nagain, just clarifying for the record if I'm correct.  The State Board of \nElections shall not provide any information on any person in the \nconfidential voter program.  So we would be protecting anyone who \nwas a victim of domestic violence or for any other reason is a \nconfidential voter?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  You are correct, sir. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  For those particular \nfolks, would then ERIC just not maintain that portion of the list \nbecause they wouldn't receive the information?  Would that be how it \nwould work?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  Correct.  If --  if the State does not \nprovide that information, then ERIC does not have access to it.\nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  And regarding other \nprivacy concerns, am I correct -- and it's enumerated between lines 31 \nand 30 -- 40 on page 2, the information that is being transmitted to \nERIC or any other organization similar, these are all \npublicly-available things that you could get if you pulled the voter list \nas any citizen.  We're not submitting to ERIC or anyone else any \ninformation that is not already publicly-available?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  That -- that's correct. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  Thank you.\nThere is a reference in the bill to fees, dues and \nexpenses.  Do we have any anticipation how much cost that would be \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n48to the State of New York?  \nMR. TAYLOR:  The estimated cost the first year to -- \nto participate is $150,000 and then there's an annual dues of $25,000 \nper year. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So there will be a startup fee \nand then 25,000 -- and that's the -- for the whole State, that's the total \ncost. \nMR. TAYLOR:  Yes, sir. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  And you -- you alluded to it \nearlier, but as we all know, noncitizens -- regardless of the legality of \ntheir status, noncitizens cannot vote.  So am I correct, there's a couple \nof protections for that in the bill on page 3, line 7.  There's a -- a -- a \npoint where it says that any solicitations that go out would make it \nclear that noncitizens can't vote -- and I will read the section -- to \navoid inadvertent or accidental registration, a person is ineligible to \nregister to vote.  Any mailing to any potentially eligible but \nunregistered person shall state the voter registration criteria, including, \nbut not limited to, any citizenship requirements. \nMR. TAYLOR:  That's correct, sir. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.  \nAnd further down on page 3 it -- it becomes statute, \nthe Commissioner shall not knowingly provide any information \npursuant to this section of persons who are not citizens. \nMR. TAYLOR:  That's correct, sir. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  Okay.   \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n49So, those are the questions I had.  I appreciate you \nclarifying some of my thoughts on it.\nI'm gonna go on the bill. \nMR. TAYLOR:  Thank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On the bill. \nMR. SEMPOLINSKI:  So, the voter rolls in the State, \nthey need a lot of work.  And -- and I would say this is somebody who \nin my private life is very politically active and -- and active in my \npolitical party and spent -- I spend a lot of time every March talking to \nfolks and getting them to sign designating petitions and what have \nyou.  And quite often, we have lists where somebody has moved, \nsadly somebody has passed away.  Somebody has registered to vote at \none particular address and then has -- has moved somewhere else.  \nAnd I do hear from constituents where there is concern in the \nconfidence of elections, and a lot of it has to do with the voter rolls.  \nSo as -- as -- I think if there are adequate protections, and it certainly \nseems to be the sponsor's intent to have those adequate protections for \nprivacy, for bipartisanship, to make sure that those who have lawfully \nregistered to vote are still registered, and those who are ineligible to \nvote don't slip in.  With those types of protections I think this -- this \nmoves us in a direction that's -- that's positive. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Molitor. \nMR. MOLITOR:  Thank you.  Actually, all of my \nquestions were asked and answered.  Thank you. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n50ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nRead the last section.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nMr. Jacobson to explain his vote. \nMR.

We used the hashtag \"RescueMs for our \nsocial media campaign, and it was intended to be ironic that we were \ncoming together to rescue EMS when we're so used to them, in fact, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n56rescuing us in -- in our times of need.  We've been chipping away at \nthis, allowing them to get paid directly for certain services, allowing \nthem to be paid for treating in place or for transporting someone to \nanother -- another location other than a hospital.  We are still \nstruggling to finalize language so that they would be recognized as an \nessential service in State law, and this measure right here which will \nbe a very important tool in the local government toolbox that will help \nus stabilize our EMS that have been struggling with staffing issues, the \nability to pay for vital equipment, infrastructure improvements, \ntraining their staff and the like. \nI want to thank all of my colleagues for their support \nfor EMS over these last couple of years.  I especially want to give a \nshout out to my neighboring colleague, who I'm sure is gonna have a \n-- to say a few words.  We have worked extremely closely together \nafter a tragic incident in our community brought us together to raise \nthese important issues. \nI also want to recognize the Association of Counties \nand the Conference of Mayors for their steadfast support in helping us \nimprove our EMS services. \nThank you very much. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Lupardo in the affirmative.\nMr. Angelino to explain his vote. \nMR.

I still have \nvolunteer, fully volunteer ambulances that are struggling, and it's \ndominoes when it comes to these ambulances.  I have certain towns \nthat have no coverage.  They don't have a ambulance service, they're \nnot in a Certificate of Need, and they rely solely on mutual aid.  And \nthis, if this is signed into law, will give these municipalities a little bit \nof -- of breathing room.  They're not going to fund an entire agency \nout of this.  Some places just need to sign a contract that might be 50 \ncents on the dollar over the 2 percent tax cap. \nI'll be voting yes on this very important piece of \nlegislation.

ZACCARO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nSince my arrival to the Assembly, I've consistently \nstrived to address the public safety and public health crisis that arose \nin the wake of the legalization of the cannabis market, from \nempowering law enforcement to shut down illicit smoke shops to \nadvocating for the revocation of State licenses from those who don't \nplay by the rules.  I've worked to ensure that our communities are \nprotected and the legal cannabis industry is given the opportunity that \nit needs to succeed, and today we're taking an important first step \nforward.  We are passing a bipartisan piece of legislation that reflects \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n67a collective effort, particularly in the community of Jackson Heights, \nQueens, where I stood with my colleagues.  I stood with families and \nschool advocates against the operation of illegal smoke shops located \ndangerously close to a school; an establishment that was selling illicit \ncannabis and putting our youth at risk.  And through this fight we \nuncovered a significant loophole in our existing laws, and today we're \nclosing that loophole.  And I'm proud to be part of a Body that has led \nthe way in refining and improving the law to strike a responsible \nbalance between opportunity and safety. \nI was concerned to learn that current regulations did \nnot account for schools and houses of worship located within \nmixed-use buildings when determining the permissible placement of \ncannabis storefronts.  And this oversight was not unique to my district, \nit was an issue across our State.  And so today we're passing a bill that \ncorrects that.  Once enacted it will prohibit cannabis storefronts from \noperating within 500 feet of a school, and 200 feet from a house of \nworship in mixed-use buildings.  And this targeted change will make a \nreal difference for public safety, especially in communities like mine.  \nAnd let me be clear.  This legislation is not intended \nto place undue burden on licensed dispensaries.  We remain \ncommitted to promoting a thriving legal cannabis industry, but the \nsuccess must go hand-in-hand with smart, community-centered \nregulation and this bill achieves that balance.  \nAnd I proudly vote in the affirmative.  Thank you, \nMadam Speaker. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n68ACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMr. Zaccaro in the affirmative. \nAre there any other votes?

GRIFFIN:  Police officers put their lives on the \nline every day to protect our communities, yet too often they do not \nreceive the essential mental health support they need by nature of their \nprofession.  This can exact a toll, both professionally and personally.  \nTommy Shevlin, President of Nassau County PBA, and police \norganizations Statewide have discussed this major issue with me, \nsharing how the repetitive trauma that police officers endure from \nresponding to violent crimes, domestic violence incidents, car \naccidents and other life-threatening situations can have a serious \nimpact on their well-being.  \nI was honored when they asked me to sponsor this \nlegislation to establish a formal peer-to-peer mental health program \nfor our police.  This is about supporting the men and women who \nprotect us every day by ensuring that they have the mental health \nresources they need to serve communities across the State effectively.  \nSadly, suicide rates for police officers are much \nhigher than for residents across the State.  In fact, statistics show law \nenforcement officers are 54 percent more likely to commit suicide \nthan the general population.  I am proud that we have passed this \nlegislation in memory of Lieutenant Joseph Banish, a State Trooper \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n74who died by suicide.  \nIt takes a team to bring legislation to the floor.  So I \nwant to thank the Speaker for his support, as well as Jen Best and her \nteam at Program and Counsel; Assemblymember Lavine and the \nJudiciary team; Assemblymembers Solages, Ramos and O'Pharrow for \nstrongly advocating to bring this bill to the floor.  I am greatly \nappreciative of the many cosponsors who signed on.  A huge thank \nyou to my Legislative Director Jen Slagen, and Legislative Associate \nMarie Curley for their efforts in getting this bill to the floor. \nSome of our bills take a few years to pass, and this \ncertainly was one of them.  I want to recognize my former colleague, \nAssemblywoman Gina Sillitti, for her dedication to this bill over the \npast two years.  This bill was passed off to me, and I'm grateful to \nGina for all of her ded -- dedicated efforts.  \nThank you very much. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMs. Griffin in the affirmative.\nMr. Durso to explain his vote.\nMR. DURSO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nFirst, I want to thank the sponsor for finally getting \nthis bill across the finish line.  Again, our friend Tommy Shevlin has \nbeen working on this piece of legislation for a long time.  And \nobviously, the suicide rates for first responders, especially our police \nofficers, has been going up exponentially.  And being able to put a \npiece of legislation like this together to not only protect them, their \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n75families, but giving them that peer-to-peer support that they need so \nthat they could do their jobs, keep us protected while we do our jobs \nhere, and help protect them is so vital.\nSo again, I want to thank the sponsor, thank my \nfriend Tommy Shevlin for all their hard work on this legislation, and \nobviously I'll be in the affirmative.\nThank you.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Durso in the affirmative.\nMr. Ra to explain his vote.  \nMR. RA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nI'm very proud to have had the opportunity to support \nthis piece of legislation.  As my colleague just mentioned, our -- our \nPBA President on Long Island in Nassau, Tommy Shevlin, has been \npushing this for -- for the last several years.  I'm glad to see it coming \nout on the floor today.  \nWe need to do more with regard to this issue.  \nUnfortunately, we've seen it far too many times that a law \nenforcement officer has -- has made the tragic decision to take -- to \ntake their own life because of what they have dealt with, the things \nthey've seen in -- in service to the public in -- in their job protecting \nthe public.\nSo I hope this has an impact on allowing those to get \nhelp, get treatment, but also that it is a step that we continue to do the \nthings we need to do to provide resources for all of our first \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n76responders so that we can stop what has been an epidemic of law \nenforcement suicides.\nSo I'm very proud to cast my vote in the affirmative.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Ra in the affirmative.\nMr. Lavine to explain his vote. \nMR. LAVINE:  Thank you.  Very briefly, I want to \nthank the sponsor.  \nThis was anything but an easy lift.  And I want to \nthank the staff as well and the Speaker as well for their involvement.  I \nalso want to thank law enforcement, not just in Nassau County, but \nlaw enforcement with whom I interacted with respect to this bill from \nSuffolk County and from New York City as well.\nThis is a highly significant piece of legislation, and I \nthink it's only fitting that law enforcement knows that we in the \nAssembly are here to protect them and to protect everyone else.\nAnd finally, this was our colleague Gina Sillitti's bill.  \nAnd Gina worked very hard on this bill as well, and I think it's only \nfair that the record reflect the efforts of the present sponsor and of the \nprior sponsor as well.  \nI am very pleased to have the chance to vote in the \naffirmative.  Thank you so much.  \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. Lavine in the affirmative.\nMs. Giglio to explain her vote. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n77MS. GIGLIO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I would \nalso like to thank the sponsor for bringing this bill forward.\nIf you've ever spoken to a law enforcement officer \nabout the challenges of their day-to-day lives, from witnessing a fatal \ncar accident to holding a baby that may have just passed away, and \nthen being expected to just pick up your life, go home, go to your kid's \nsoftball game, go about your daily life.  And it's really very \nchallenging for all law enforcement and emergency services.  So this \npeer support bill is really a very good step in the direction to help law \nenforcement and anybody that's facing these challenging jobs on a \nday-to-day basis.\nSo I'd also like to thank Tommy Shevlin, because if \nyou haven't heard his story you probably should.  And it's a shame that \nit took this long to get this bill to the floor for a vote, but I'm happy \nthat it did.  And we pray for our law enforcement and for our \nemergency services every day, and thank them for the job that they do, \nwhich is one that we may not choose to do so, but they do it and -- and \nthey still manage to survive and go home to their families at night.\nSo thank you again to the sponsor.  Thank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMs. Giglio in the affirmative. \nMs. Shimsky to explain her vote.\nMS. SHIMSKY:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nWe talk a lot about mental health issues and how \nmany we have at this point.  It's a problem across the board, but \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n78especially with certain specialized groups, one of which is our first \nresponders.  And one way to fill the gaps is with peer-to-peer \ncounselors.  But with the way the law was written, it compromised the \nability of peer-to-peer counselors to be as helpful to their base of \nclients as they should be.  \nSo I am very proud to support this bill.  I -- I thank \nour colleagues on Long Island for working so hard to get this across \nthe finish line, including our former colleague Gina Sillitti, and \nincluding our once and current colleague Ms. Griffin.  And I -- I'm \nglad to see that the support is so widespread.  That is why I'm voting \nin the affirmative.   \nThank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.\nMs. Shimsky in the affirmative. \nMr. Stern to explain his vote. \nMR. STERN:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nI, too, have many times heard the story from \nPresident Tom Shevlin from Nassau County, speaking about personal \nexperiences as well of those of his membership that applies obviously \nnot just to the outstanding men and women of the Nassau County law \nenforcement agencies, but to all of so many of our local heroes that \nserve all of us throughout New York State.   \nThis is an important day.  And it is, as my colleagues \nhave pointed out, a long time coming with an awful lot of members \nand supporters having worked so hard to make this a -- a reality.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n79We know that a Dwyer-like peer-to-peer support \nprogram is a quantifiable model that has been proven to have a \ntremendous impact on saving lives, and our law enforcement \ncommunity deserves no less.  These are services that are gonna make \na real difference.  A real difference in the lives of those that have \nserved us and there are families and communities that support them.  \nI also very quickly want to point out so many of the \nadvocates in the law enforcement agencies all throughout New York \nState, so many of them who we know, who we are close with, who we \nare friendly with who serve an important role up here in Albany on a \ndaily basis.  This has been one of their very top priorities for years.  \nAnd so again, it is an important day to see it finally becoming a \nreality.  \nTo our colleague Judy Griffin, congratulations.  A \nlong time coming, an awful lot of hard work.  But this is a good day \nfor our friends in law enforcement.  An important message that we all \nsend not just to those that serve us in law enforcement, but to so many \nwho deal with mental health challenges and -- and thoughts of suicide; \nrates which are way too high, which should be unacceptable to all of \nus.  That this is a program that works and one that will -- we can all be \nvery proud of going forward.\nThank you.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Stern in the affirmative. \nMr. O'Pharrow to explain his vote. \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n80MR. O'PHARROW:  I'm very proud of this bill, and \nthank you to the sponsor, Judy, for bringing this bill to the floor.  You \nand I had several conversations behind closed doors, and I, for one, \nwho stood 25 years wearing the shield know how important it is for \nthis bill to come forth.  \nI had a few, quite a few, and too many colleagues in \nlaw enforcement that took their lives.  And this bill gives them the \nopportunity to train in peer-to-peer counseling so that this doesn't \nhappen again.  \nMind you, this bill is not just for law enforcement.  \nThis bill is for everybody.  This is the people that protect us.  We need \nto do our due diligence to protect them.  We need to protect those that \nprotect us.  \nAnd Judy, thank you so very much for bringing this \nbill forward.  I -- I know it was very challenging for you.  But I was \nright by your side to guide you and making those phone calls to those \npeople of New York State that need to hear that this needs to be done.  \nSo, thank you so very much.  Congratulations.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMr. O'Pharrow in the affirmative. \nMs. Buttenschon to explain her vote. \nMS. BUTTENSCHON:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  \nAnd to our sponsor, I sincerely appreciate your hard work as well as \nso many colleagues that brought support.  \nEveryone has spoken today of the importance of what \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n81law enforcement does for all of us, and clearly, this is an opportunity \nfor us to reflect and remember that there are days that they need us \nand we want to ensure that we do provide that.\nSo again, I echo the thoughts of everyone that has \nspoken today, and I thank our colleagues for their hard work to bring \nthis forward. \nThank you. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMs. Buttenschon in the affirmative. \nMr. Gandolfo to explain his vote. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.\nFirst, thank you to the sponsor for getting this bill \nover the finish line.  We've seen how successful the Joseph P. Dwyer \npeer-to-peer support program has been for our veterans, and to now \nexpand this type of peer-to-peer support to our police officers is just \nsuch a great step forward.  \nOur police officers and our first responders, they face \nimmense pressures every single day.  If you've ever been in a situation \nwhere you had to call a police officer, that relief you felt at the darkest \n-- one of the darkest moments in your life, they are responding to \nsituations like that all of the time and carrying that with them.  And \nunfortunately, those pressures can get to them and too many have \nsuffered in silence, as we've seen with police officers taking their own \nlives.  \nWith what we're doing here is going to save lives.  I \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n82am so proud to vote for this bill.  I would like to thank the Nassau \nPBA President, Tommy Shelvin -- Shevlin, sorry, for his work \nadvocating (indicating) for this bill, and all of the law enforcement \nadvocates we see walking the hallways up here every week that we're \nup here, to advocate for their needs.\nSo, again, congratulations to the sponsor.  This bill is \ngoing to save lives. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nMr. Gandolfo in the affirmative.\nAre there any other votes?  Announce the results.\n(The Clerk announced the results.) \nThe bill is passed.\nMr. Gandolfo for the purposes of an introduction. \nMR. GANDOLFO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. \nOn behalf of our colleague Robert Smullen, I have \nthe pleasure of introducing Mrs. Allen's class, 5th grade Social \nStudies, from the West Canada Valley School.  They are here with us \nin the Chamber today, observing our proceedings and learning a little \nbit about how our State government works here.  Hopefully they are \nenjoying what they see with some of the thoughtful discussions and \ncomments being made here.  \nAnd I would ask that you welcome them and offer \nthem all of the cordialities of the House. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  On behalf of Mr. \nGandolfo, Mr. Smullen, the Speaker and all members, welcome, \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n83young people, to the Assembly Chamber.

An act to amend the County Law, in relation to \neye and tissue donation.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Read the last \nsection.\nTHE CLERK:  This act shall take effect immediately. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  The Clerk will \nrecord the vote.\n(The Clerk recorded the vote.) \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n85Ms. Woerner to explain her vote. \nMS. WOERNER:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for \nallowing me to interrupt our proceedings to explain my vote.\nThis bill provides that when a death occurs outside of \na hospital, that the coroner or medical examiner who is responsible for \nprocessing that -- that death, reach out to organ procurement \norganizations -- have a protocol to reach out to organ procurement \norganizations to alert them if they have a -- a donor that is -- that is \ninterested -- they have somebody who's interested in being an organ \ndonor.  Because they can do a tissue and -- donation up -- an eye and \ntissue donation up to 24 hours after someone has passed away.\nAnd just to give you a sense of context, one tissue \ndonor can save or heal 75 people.  So being able to take advantage of \nsomeone's willingness to be an organ donor and to donate in this way \nwhen they don't die in a hospital is such -- is just an important step \nforward in New York.\nSo I am so pleased to bring this bill to you, to have \nyou all support this.  Because I think this is a going to be just a -- a \nway that -- that New York can -- can move forward and save more \nlives through organ donation.\nSo thank you very much to the Speaker and to the \ncosponsors for helping me bring this to the floor, and to all of you for \nvoting in the affirmative.  And with that, I vote in the affirmative.\nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you. \nMs. Woerner in the affirmative.\nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n86Ms. Walsh to explain her vote. \nMS. WALSH:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, I really \nam so happy to see this bill getting done.  \nI was approached a few years ago by the Saratoga \nCounty Coroner, Susan Hayes-Masa, who said something that I didn't \nknow, which is that -- and -- and the previous speaker just referred to \nit -- that the viability of eye and tissue is longer than for other organs.  \nSo there's a missed opportunity unless we can somehow create a \nprotocol where we're at least allowing the chance for people who \nwanted to be donors to have that donation actually take place.  And \nSusan knew this because of her long -- many years of work with the -- \nwith the Lions Club, and of course, their mission has a lot to do with \neyes.  And I think that it's -- it's wonderful because this bill really \ncloses a loophole, because Federal law, since 1998, requires hospitals \nto refer deaths to organ procurement organizations.  But no such \nFederal or New York State requirement exists for coroners or medical \nexaminers, which creates a referral loophole.  This loophole limits \ndonation potential when deaths fall under the jurisdiction  of coroners \nor medical examiners.  And so this bill will help to close that \nloophole.  I think that it really will assist in healing and helping so \nmany people, potentially, and I'm so glad to support it.  And I'd really \nlike to thank the sponsor for her work over the years with me to get \nthis done.\nThank you so much.  I'll be in the affirmative. \nACTING SPEAKER HUNTER:  Thank you.  \nNYS ASSEMBLY                                                               JUNE 6, 2025\n87Ms. Walsh in the affirmative.\nMr. Palmesano to explain his vote.\nMR. PALMESANO:  Yes.  Madam Speaker and my \ncolleagues.\nThis is another bill in a series of bills that we've seen \ncome to the floor of the Assembly dealing with organ donation and \neye and tissue donation.  You know, I know a lot of times on the floor \nwhen we get up we have our disagreements, our frustrations with each \nother on bills and policy.  This issue of organ donation and tissue and \neye donation, I have to say how proud I am to be part of this Body and \nwhat we're doing together in a bipartisan fashion.  Because this is \nabout saving lives.  And the actions this Chamber has taken, working \ntogether with the Senate and the Governor, we are, indeed, saving \nlives.  \nSo continue to take more steps like this; making it \neasier for people to sign up to be an organ donor, taking some of the \nregulations and -- and red tape out of the way so we can impact others.  \nAnd just think about this bill.  Think about how many people -- my \ncolleague mentioned 75 people.  One statistic I always use is one \nperson who donates at the time of their death can save up to eight \nlives and impact the lives of 75 others.
